In this notebook we'll build various machine learning models to predict the amount of rented bikes each day.

We'll start with simple linear regression model, just to confirm the hunch that it won't perform well. 
Then we'll move on to Random Forest Regressor and perform basic GridSearch to tweak that model. 
After that we'll test other models, including gradient boosting models and neural networks. 
Having tested quite a few models we'll move on to stacking them together.
