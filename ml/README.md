# Machine Learning

### 🚙 [ML car prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/intro_car_prices) - Introduction to ML with k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 
I've extended the project with testing out multiple random seeds, checking many column combinations and different dataframe versions (based on cleaning techniques).

### 🏠 [ML house prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/house_prices) - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices.
Multiple feature engineering layers to merge various numeric and categorical columns into 1. Using feature selection techniques and testing different outliers removal methods. 
### :taxi: [ML NYC taxi trips](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/taxis_large) - An ongoing project with large datasets of NYC taxi trips.
The core idea of this project is to experience working with large data. Using pandas big data techniques or Dask library to manage importing and merging  datasets, all while trying to fit under strict memory limitations of a kaggle notebook.

### 📋 [Project feedback](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/nlp_feedback) -  Scraping and analyzing projects feedback. 
Another BeautifulSoup scraping session gathered feedback to all of the published projects on Dataquest forum. Having gathered a lof of text data. I've tested different NLP techniques, applied supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to analyze text data. 

### 🚲 [Bike Sharing](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/bikes) - Using multiple regression models to predict rental count
Random Forest hyperparameter optimization using GridSearch, gathering more weather data using meteostat, testing various regression models, small steps into stacking models: averaging predictions of multiple models and using neural network model as a meta model.
