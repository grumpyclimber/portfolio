# Machine Learning projects

### üöô [ML car prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/intro_car_prices) - Introduction to ML with k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 
I've extended the project with testing out multiple random seeds, checking many column combinations and different dataframe versions (based on cleaning techniques).

### üè† [ML house prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/house_prices) - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices.
Using feature selection techniques, outliers removal and feature engineering.
### :taxi: [ML NYC taxi trips](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/taxis_large) - An ongoing project with large datasets of NYC taxi trips.
Importing and merging them with other data, all while trying to fit under strict memory limitations of a kaggle notebook.

### üìã [Project feedback](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ml/nlp_feedback) -  Scraping and analyzing projects feedback. 
Scraping feedback to all of the published projects on Dataquest forum. Testing out different NLP techniques, applying machine learning to analyze text data.
