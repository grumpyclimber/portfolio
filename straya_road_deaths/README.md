Having done a few machine learning projects recently, I needed a break. So I've done a short data analysis on Australian Fatal Road Accidents in years 1989-2020. 
Just the basics: clean the data a bit and look for some patterns over the last 30 years. 

The general trend is naturally very positive:

But as we dive deeper into the dataset, we can isolate some worrying facts:
