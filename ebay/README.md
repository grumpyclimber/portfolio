# Ebay car sales data analysis

This is the first project I've decided to publish. Apart from doing the usual data cleaning as requested by Dataquest for this project, I have chalanged myself to do a few additional tasks:
* extracted engine size from 'name' column where it was easily achieveble (in about 14500 rows)
* filled 4000 cells of power column with average power value for each brand respectively (instead of filling it with an average power value for the whole database)
* inspected rows with 'sontiage_autos' brand and reassigned 80% of these entries to their correct brand
* came across faulty data in post-2015 entries (and removed it)
* plotted average price data on the map of Germany

libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Geopandas
