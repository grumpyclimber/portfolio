# Portfolio
Hello world, here are my humble beginnings of a portfolio, most of the below projects are based on well known datasets, but in each and every one of them I've pushed myself to outshine the standard scope of the project.  If I couldn't find anything new in the data, and my project would look the same as every other notebook, I've collected new data (like in Fandango project). No idea or room for new data? Then I've grabbed a brush and worked on the visualizations. (eg. Star Wars). At this stage I'm focusing on machine learning projects. The portfolio is divided into 3 parts:

🔍 1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#eda)  

🎰 2. Machine Learning

🪄 3. Tricks and intros

# Exploratory Data Analysis

### :car: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ebay">Ebay cars</a> - A deeper analysis of a well known car dataset. 
I've managed to find a few more things among the rows. 

### :computer:  <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/coders_survey">Coders survey</a> - Analysis of coders survey. 
A battle of mean, median and mode functions.

### 👾 <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/star_wars">Star Wars</a> - This one is all about the style... 
I've even plotted a death-star !

###  :movie_camera: [Fandango](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/fandango) - Extended version of Fandango ratings analysis. 
Includes scraping movies budget data from wikipedia.

### 🚑 [Road fatalities](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/straya_road_deaths) - A basic analysis of road fatalities on Australian roads
A bit of a break from recent ML projects - a quick EDA on a relatively simple dataset.

# Machine Learning

### 🚙 [ML car prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ML_intro_car_prices) - Introduction to ML with k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 
I've extended the project with testing out multiple random seeds, checking many column combinations and different dataframe versions (based on cleaning techniques).

### 🏠 [ML house prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ML_house_prices) - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices.
Using feature selection techniques, outliers removal and feature engineering.
### :taxi: [ML NYC taxi trips](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/taxis_big_ML) - An ongoing project with large datasets of NYC taxi trips.
Importing and merging them with other data, all while trying to fit under strict memory limitations of a kaggle notebook.

### 📋 [Project feedback](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/nlp_feedback) -  Scraping and analyzing projects feedback. 
Scraping feedback to all of the published projects on Dataquest forum. Testing out different NLP techniques, applying machine learning to analyze text data.

# Tricks and intros:
### 🔡 [Scraping data](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/wiki_scrape) - scraping data from Wikipedia pages.
Getting introduced to web-scraping with BeautifulSoup, we'll develop a function to extract budget data from the website. 

### :fishing_pole_and_fish: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/tricks">Tricks</a> - Mix of short and easy tricks, hacks and intros.
Giving back, improving on others work and explaining your work is an essential part of learning how to code. In this folder I'll try to include some of my notebook that can be helpful. 

### :globe_with_meridians: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/maps">Maps</a> - Quick and easy intro to geopandas.
Using the ebay dataset to conduct a quick tutorial to geospatial visualization with Geopandas.
