# Portfolio
Hello world, here are my humble beginnings of a portfolio:

1. :car: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ebay">ebay</a> - A touch deeper analysis of a well know ebay car dataset. I've managed to find a few more odd things among the rows.
2. :globe_with_meridians: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/maps">maps</a> - Quick and easy intro to geopandas.
3. :computer:  <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/coders_survey">coders_survey</a> - Analysis of coders survey. A battle of mean, median and mode functions.
4. :fishing_pole_and_fish: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/tricks">tricks</a> - Mix of short and easy tricks or hacks.
5. ðŸ‘¾: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/star_wars">Star Wars</a> - This one is all about the style... I've even plotted a death-star
