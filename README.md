# Portfolio
Hello world, here are my humble beginnings of a portfolio, you've probably noticed that most of the below projects are based on well known datasets, but in each and every one of them I've pushed myself to outshine the standard scope of the project.  If I couldn't find anything new in the data, and my project would look the same as every other notebook, I've collected new data (like in Fandango project). No idea or room for new data? Then I've grabbed a brush and worked on the visualizations. (eg. Star Wars). At this stage I'm focusing on machine learning projects.


1. :car: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ebay">ebay</a> - A deeper analysis of a well know car dataset. I've managed to find a few more things among the rows.
2. :globe_with_meridians: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/maps">maps</a> - Quick and easy intro to geopandas.
3. :computer:  <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/coders_survey">coders_survey</a> - Analysis of coders survey. A battle of mean, median and mode functions.
4. :fishing_pole_and_fish: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/tricks">tricks</a> - Mix of short and easy tricks or hacks.
5. 👾: <a href="https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/star_wars">Star Wars</a> - This one is all about the style... I've even plotted a death-star !
6. 🔡: [scraping data](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/wiki_scrape) - Using BeautifulSoup to scrape budget data from Wikipedia pages.
7. :movie_camera: [Fandango](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/fandango) - Extended version of Fandango ratings analysis. Includes scraping movies budget data from wiki.
8. 🚙 [ML car prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ML_intro_car_prices) - Introduction to ML with k-nearest neighbors algorithm, I've extended the project with testing out multiple random seeds, checking many column combinations and different dataframe versions (based on cleaning techniques).
9. 🏠: [ML house prices](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/ML_house_prices) - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices, using feature selection techniques, outlier removal and feature engineering.
10. :taxi: [ML NYC taxi trips](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/taxis_big_ML) - An ongoing project involving importing large datasets of NYC taxi trips, merging them with other data, all while trying to fit under strict memory limitations.
11. 🚑 [Road fatalities](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/straya_road_deaths) - A small and basic analysis project regarding road fatalities on Australian roads in the last 30 years.
12. 📋: [Project feedback](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/nlp_feedback) -  Scraping and analyzing feedback of all the published projects on Dataquest forum. Testing out different NLP techniques, applying machine learning to analyze text data.
