TL;DR: here's my Wikipedia movie budget scraping function, gimme feedback:

While doing my Star Wars project, I've did a basic scrape of movie data using Wikipedia library. That gave me an idea how to expand on the fandango project 
- scrape movie budget data and analyse rating shift based on the budget... and other factors I can scrape from the page

But I need to scrape the budget data first, Wikipedia library can't deliver that, I imagine that Wikipedia API would be a good way to do it 
(haven't touched that topic yet it's on the list of things to do) but I've wanted to try scraping the data from a webpage (because I've never done it) - 
here's how I've done it, I'm curious about the feedback:

sample of my df (I've made the titles a bit more url friendly):

| FILM                                | title_urled                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)      | avengers_age_of_ultron_2015        |
| Cinderella (2015)                   | cinderella_2015                    |
| Ant-Man (2015)                      | ant_man_2015                       |

The whole step by step instruction are on my jupyter notebook:
