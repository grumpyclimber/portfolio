**TL;DR: I wrote a function to scrape Wikipedia for movie budgets, gimme feedback:**

While doing my [Star Wars project](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/blob/main/star_wars/star_wars2.csv), I did a basic scrape of movie data using Wikipedia library. That gave me an idea how to expand on the fandango project - scrape movie budget data and analyse rating shift based on the budget... and other factors I can scrape from the page.

But for now I need to scrape the budget data first, Wikipedia library can't deliver that, I imagine that Wikipedia API would be a good way to do it 
(haven't touched that topic yet it's on the list of things to do) but I've wanted to try scraping the data from a webpage (because I've never done it) - 
here's how I've done it, I'm curious about the feedback:
