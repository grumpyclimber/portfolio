# Exploratory Data Analysis

### :car: [Ebay cars](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/eda/ebay) - A deeper analysis of a well known car dataset. 
This dataset very often serves as an introduction to pandas. Students focused on surviving their first coding project forget to unleash their curiosity. Because of that the dataset has a lot of untapped potential: extracting engine size from the cars names, identyfing sontiage_autos, identyfying the issue with post-2015 entries to name a few. It's also a perfect dataset for a basic introduction to geopandas.

### ðŸ‘¾ [Star Wars](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/eda/star_wars) - This one is all about the style... 
Star Wars fans survey is a small dataset that doesn't give us a lot potential for analysis. To make it more interesting I've decided to work on the visuals of this notebook. Custom fonts, color palettes, and lots of plots. I've even plotted a death-star. The force is strong with this one.

###  :movie_camera: [Fandango](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/eda/fandango) - Extended version of Fandango ratings analysis. 
To dig deeper into Fandangos rating shift I've gathered more data, specifically distribution company and budget data for each movie. I've set up a BeautifulSoup scraper get the required information from Wikipedia. That gives us a better look how movie budgets and their distributors affect the ratings.   

### ðŸš‘ [Road fatalities](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/straya_road_deaths) - A basic analysis of road fatalities on Australian roads
A bit of a break from recent ML projects - a quick EDA on a relatively simple dataset. Australian roads became much safer in the last 30 years. But that change doesn't affect everybody equally. Some social groups and locations are becoming more common in road fatalities.
