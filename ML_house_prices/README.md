This is my second attempt at ML, this time I'm learning a linear regression model. Using this model we're trying to predict house prices based on various property features.

New concepts that I've had to wrap my brain around:
* Linear regression
* Outlier removal
* Feature engineering
* Overfitting
* I've also started conducting more and more data processing inside functions - to preserve memory, it's a good start before working on my [large data project](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/taxis_big_ML)

Here's an example plot of my results:
