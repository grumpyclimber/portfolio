processing data inside a function saves memory (the variables you create stay inside the function and are not stored in memory, when you’re done with the function) it’s important when you’re working with larger datasets - if you’re interested with experimenting:

Try cleaning 1 month of this dataset on kaggle notebook (and look at your RAM usage) outside the function and inside the function, compare the RAM usage in both examples

Hi,
I’ve been going through your project and thought I could provide some tips to make it better. It is clear that you’ve put in effort but some more kinks would help it get to the top.


Presentation

I would recommend having a section that clearly marks introduction and conclusion to help non-technical viewers quickly go over the main thread of your project and its outcome. In addition, I would include a link from where the viewers could download the dataset to help them go over the data if they so chose to.
The Data exploration section is apt. It clearly gives details about the data. However the Data Clean-up section could use some more work. While you have given details on the columns you intend to clean, it would be best to provide context to why you have chosen those columns to clean and how they might affect your data analysis.
Of your two graphs the Most Popular Tags graph is really neat and seems to follow most of the Gestalt Principles.  In contrast the Top 20 Tags by Usage & Views graph needs some work.
You have shared your thoughts and analysis after each table and graph which is really good. However, I noticed that you ended the section Popularity Marker Overlap  with the assumption that knowledge of  the datascience domain is common place with the use of “With our knowledge of the datascience domain, we can see that…”. It may not be to the reader, therefore it is best to provide a link to some references that may help the user get a better understanding of the domain. You could also have a special section that gives an idea of the domain to the user.




 Coding Style
I only did a quick analysis of your coding and I feel your coding style is good.

I think you have done a good job with coding. The style seems to be consistent. All the comments are in place
You have not shirked away from using descriptive variable names which is really helpful




 Bugs

I noticed that you have SettingwithCopyWarning warnings. I did run your code and I was able to remove it. I would recommend that you go over this blog post which should help you to remove the error. I know its a long read but its a worthy investment.
This next one I’m not sure of, but in the 41st cell you have created a function for normalization.  I believe that you are trying to standardize the columns but your formula is something that I’m not aware of. I believe the correct formula for standardizing is . I go this from here . I could be wrong and I would recommend if someone else could comment.




 Miscellaneous

You have re-run the project from the beginning and that’s very helpful in numbering and identifying the cells correctly
It appears neat if you leave space above each comment so that the code and its associated comment can be segregated neatly.


That all from me. Overall good job   and keep projecting on

GP: Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys ++,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/558265/4,"


noticed that you’re deleting objects, after you’re done with them - that’s a good habit - think you should start using gc.collect() to clear the memory, article: 2 Different Ways to Clear Memory in Python - Python Pool


Maybe it’s just me but it feels like the notebook is loooong, I think that in a few examples you didnt have to display so many rows



I always start with a ridiculously long notebook and trim it a lot before publishing - it’s always hard, because you want to show/ tell so much but on the other side if you put too much in there not many will read it or get to the very end

CIA Factbook Data Analysis. Request for review,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/cia-factbook-data-analysis-request-for-review/558085,"
Hello!
Well done on this analysis! I thought the drilldown on Eastern Europe you chose to explore was interesting and a logical next step considering the result it stemmed from. The code itself was also well formatted and easy to read.
An area I think could be cleaned up would be focusing the output of the tables, especially when you are just interested in and talking about the output of one metric. As a reader scanning a table of (±) 10 columns when only 2-4 were really relevant to a specific analysis question made it slightly more difficult to read.
One  last small formatting thing was there are numbered and bulleted lists of only one value - it may be cleaner to remove those and turn them into smaller subheaders by adding hashtags infront of those words.
Well done and happy learning!

"Nobody Likes Traffic, I-94 Guided Project",2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/nobody-likes-traffic-i-94-guided-project/558173/4,"
@brucemcminn
Your project was indeed clean. It does show. I would appreciate it if you could let me know what extension you use to check spellings in the markdowns. I often miss this myself.
Presentation:

It goes without saying that the project has been nicely done.
I think some more detail could go in to the headers. The header should be an independent entity e.g. If I jumped straight to the Daytime Group section it doesn’t provide clarity on what the section is about. An alternate title could be Daytime Traffic Analysis.
I noticed that in each section you provide your analysis summary before the analysis. I usually find it easier to see the analysis first and then go over what you have extracted from it. This is especially helpful when you have graphs because you have seen the graph and the analysis thereafter validates it.
For every section it would be good to have a title, followed by a small intro then the analysis and finally your observations.
You have provided a nice, neat conclusion.

Coding Style:

You have not shirked away from appropriately naming your variables which is good to see.
I would consider leaving space above each comment just so that the comment and the code associated to it are nice and separate.

Miscellaneous:

I would suggest using more colors besides yellow. I noticed that you highlighted both the weather data and traffic volume data(histogram) in yellow. I would suggest using different colors to highlight different kinds of analysis.

So there you go that was my two cents. I hope it is of some value. Keep up the good work  and project on

Guided project - Store analysis by using SQLite,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-store-analysis-by-using-sqlite/558112/4,"
Hi Giovanni,
Thanks for sharing your amazing project with the Community!  You’ve done a super-great and profound job, and it was a really cool idea to deviate from the initial instructions and complete much more extra tasks. Excellent project structure, great approach of combining SQL with pandas and plotly, easy-to-read and elegant code (both pandas and SQL), perfectly styled SQL code (I especially liked that you used the “rivers”), awesome and highly informative dataviz,  curious observations and conclusions.
I have only few minor suggestions:

Please add a title to your project.
Remove this phrase from the introduction: So, having a project like this in your portfolio can help demonstrate your skills.

It’s better to remove some obvious code comments (##reading the dataframe,   ## plotting graph). By the way, use only one hash symbol before each comment, just to avoid cluttering.
In some code cells ([15], [19], [20], [22], [29]), you can consider rounding the output values to avoid an excessive precision.
It’s better to make plot titles bigger.
About the interactive plots. While in general it’s a cool idea, and such interactivity can be really helpful in some cases, this feature is, unfortunately, lost in the pdf version. Well, this was actually a rhetoric complaint, not an advice 


Hope my suggestions were useful. Good luck with your future projects, keep up this high level of work!

Hi @markmaguire1986
Welcome to the community and thanks for sharing your project on Heavy Traffic Indicators. The introduction is well displayed with the links of the dataset used nicely presented, the explanations given in the markdown cell, the conclusion are so informative and organized , thumbs up buddy for the good work!  I can see you have directed your analysis  to daytime traffic  and the entire process is  wonderful, what if you did the same for nighttime, I think they would have created good comparison.
Have got few humble suggestions to make;


You have hardly used the comments, remember with the comments readers can easily adapt  with  the code lines that might appear complex.


Have also noticed SettingWithCopyWarning: error which is very  common when working with  a dataframe, you can go through  SettingwithCopyWarning: How to Fix This Warning in Pandas 


You haven’t given  a title to some of your graph, like the one in cell[6], hope you will checked into that.


Be  very careful with the typos,  you have noticed some, like in the explanations given in cell[16] I think you meant right and not righth.


Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and well worked on, congratulations mate for the well organized project ,Keep it up!
Happy learning

Hi @vinaynathan99! Congratulations on finishing your first SQL project:)
You have a nice, short, and easy-to-follow project that was enjoyable to read.
Some suggestions from my side:

I think, your code style can be improved. You can refer to this guide

Make sure to write a summary where you wrap up the results of your analysis
Make sure that the subheadings’ style is the same (for example, each word should be capitalized)
I suppose, you have a critical error when you compute the number of added population in [12]. You say that India will add 1.5 billion persons next year which cannot be correct. Check the formula

Hi @erikriggleman
Welcome to Dataquest community and thanks for sharing your   project with the community. Have gone  through the  project and honestly  I  can affirm that the entire working is excellent.  I love the way you have managed to do the  cleansing of the data  like checking on the shifted column, the missing data and so on, the steps are indeed well managed.  The introduction , the use of comments and explanations given are  very informing. Keep it up mate for the good work.
Have a suggestion to make;

you  ought to have re-run  the whole  project to  achieve the sequential ordering  of the code cells, having skipped numbering is not that good.

Otherwise congratulation mate for the   good presentation. All the best in your upcoming projects.

Hi @dh7hong! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. You have a nice project and I especially liked your comments on the code, these are very useful for your and others’ reference in order to understand the code.
However, there are some suggestions from my side:

Most of your analysis is a copy-paste from the DQ solution notebook. Try to analyze the data autonomously to comprehend better the concepts of data analysis
At some point, you stopped commenting on the code. Do it all the time you think it may not be clear at the first glance
Also add comments to your functions. You can use docstrings for this purpose
In the Data Cleaning part motivate your decisions: provide the link to the thread that found the error in  row 10473
Describe the data set you’ve used. Provide the link to the source and briefly explain what these data sets are about. It’s also a good idea to link data dictionaries
Limit the length of the displayed output. You don’t need every single genre/category to be displayed since you are interested only in the most popular ones
Rerun the notebook after you finished the project to make code cell numbers consecutive

That’s it for me. Happy coding

Hi Adam,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community, you’ve done a super-great job!  The visualizations are just stunning aesthetically and at the same time highly informative, great navigation throughout the project (including back to top), the whole work is very well-organized and the code perfectly commented. Also,  you used plenty of interesting libraries, digged deep into the data, and outlined the lessons learned in your post. Amazing job!
About your question: I’d suggest you to create functions for these purposes. Indeed, you don’t use them in this project at all.
Some minor suggestions from my side:

It’s better to put the title in the very beginning of the project.
A good practice is to combine adjacent code cells without any output or markdown observations between them into one cell (e.g., [2]-[3], [5]-[6], [7]-[8], [9]-[11]). Just add empty lines of code comments between different blocks of code.
The code cell [31]: consider adding an empty line before the code comment # DEATH STAR MOD:

Use the word “observations” instead of “conclusions”  throughout the project,  and the word “conclusions” - only for the final ones.

Hope my ideas  were helpful. Very well done, congratulations!

Yacking Hackers,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/yacking-hackers/557829/4,"
nice one,

I can see you’ve already started using links in the markdown - maybe add some internal links to ease the navigation?  it’s an easy way to start shining
clean out the  multiple empty lines in code, don’t need 2 or 3 empty lines (eg. In [1]: )

remove empty lines at the end of a code cell (eg. In[6]: )


merge code cells that don’t generate any output (eg In[2]: , In[3]: )
I like to number my sections - to make it easier to navigate, and I like to keep my imports at the top, BUT it’s debatable and different guides / people  will have a different opinion on the matter (like the below 2 guides have different opinion on imports:)

Hi @angular.steve! Thanks for sharing your first project with the Community. That’s excellent that you’ve provided links to the data sets you used in the project (but I think it’s better to have links pointing to the original source of the data). Your code style is also very good and you even tried commenting on the code which is great as it improves the readability for other coders.
Some suggestions from my side:

Give your project a title that summarizes its aim
Write a conclusion where you give recommendations to the company that wants to develop an app
Improve your subheadings: you can have two main ones like Data Analysis and Data Cleaning and more granular inner paragraphs that explain each part of the project
Provide an explanation to each code chunk because sometimes it’s hard to find out why you did it. For example, when you remove non-English applications, you did not motivate your decision
Try to avoid technical description of the functions in Markdown (after cell [60]). However, you can include docstrings that describe the behaviour and the aim of each of your functions
Before submitting the project, rerun all the cells to have consecutive order

I invite you to read this style guide that will help you to improve the project and make it easy-to-follow and more attractive to potential readers. I hope my feedback was useful!

Predicting House Sale Prices(By Using Linear Regression),1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-house-sale-prices-by-using-linear-regression/557516,"
Hi Aditya!
Thanks for sharing your project. I took a look through your notebook, and here are a few of the suggestions that I have based on what I saw:

There are a lot of opportunities in this dataset to do what is called feature engineering. For example:

There are four columns representing the number of bathrooms in each house - 'Bsmt Half Bath', 'Bsmt Full Bath', 'Full Bath',  and 'Half Bath'.  Rather than fitting the model to each of these columns individually, you can fit them to a calculated column that is the sum of all of them (the total number of bathrooms in the house).
Total Baths = Full Baths + Bsmt Full Baths + 0.5 * (Half Baths + Bsmt Half Baths)
The idea is that the total number of bathrooms is, by itself, a batter predictor of home price than the four individual columns are by themselves.


When you are doing machine learning, it is important to check for collinearity

Collinearity occurs when you use two or more columns in a machine learning model that are correlated with each other. For example:
The total number of rooms in a house is likely strongly correlated to the total square footage of the house.
Including collinear columns in your models can lead to accidental overemphasis of a particular feature, or even failed model fitting in extreme cases.


Take a look at this article on using categorical columns. This is a way to take the non-numeric data given in the dataset and change it into usable, quantified data for use in the model.

I also have a few stylistic suggestions:

I saw that you updated your transform_features function a few times throughout your notebook. As a reader, I found that confusing. Consider just showing the completed function and avoid redefining the function several times throughout  your notebook.
There are many times in your finished notebook where you print out all the columns in a dataframe or other plain-text information. As a reader, it is difficult to identify the important parts of that information. I would personally remove as many of those print-out points as I could or replace them with more digestible graphics.

Overall, good job! Your RMSE of $28k is a great start.

Answering Business Questions Using SQL With Charts,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/answering-business-questions-using-sql-with-charts/557838/2,"
Hi @drill_n_bass,
Thanks for sharing another cool project with the Community, and I’m especially glad that my project on the same topic was useful for your work too!  You did a really great job and dug deeper into the data obtaining a lot of curious insights. I liked a lot of things in your project: helpful and insightful visualizations,  efficient SQL code formatting, rounding output numbers, interesting storytelling, the overall project structure. My favorite part of your analysis is the chapter about Employee Sales Performance. Well done indeed!
Some suggestions from my side:

Add a project title and a conclusion section. Also, I’d sugest you to add a section Way forward, where to put the last 2 sentences from the current version of your project (by the way, those were really cool observations!).
It’s better to avoid too detailed technical explanations in the body of  the project, or at least make them laconic and put as code comments. I mean, for example, this phrase at the beginning of your project: To run SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook, we have to add %%sql on its own line to the start of our query. Or your readers already know how to do it, or they will understand it directly from your code, or it’s their problem 

The code cell [3]: in the output, I see also the “views” that actually were not created at that step of the project. Since here we’re interested only in the initial information, I’d suggest you to restart kernel first and only then to re-run the whole project.
The code cells [11] and [13]. Remove the commented-out pieces of code and consider creating a function for both plots in each case. Moreover, I think, you can even create a function for all the bar plots in your project.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Keep learning and good luck with your future projects!
Ah, and congratulations on winning the Writing Contest!

Lame Cars Are A Better Deal,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/lame-cars-are-a-better-deal/557678/6,"

I like the ratio idea, it actually opens up few new possibilities like: how much each brand/model is losing of that ratio per year, which ones hold their value regardless of mileage and definitely how engine size affects that ratio  (I’ve extracted engine size in my proj)
I would title the conclusions and put them at the end, no coding after conclusions.
make those plots bigger
If you’re playing with postcodes, you should try geopandas ( I’ve used this car dataset to try and learn the basics  of geopandas: My intro to GDP


When it comes to postcode corelation…
it is true at the north end of the country,but doesn’t really work as you move towards the center (highest postcode numbers), south has a higher average price

Hi @ifediorah.kenechukwu! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! In my opinion, you have a very easy-to-follow project that is enjoyable to read. You’ve also extensively used comments to tell us what your code does, which is a great habit for every programmer. You maintained the same code style throughout the code which is important for the readability, well done!
Some suggestions from  my side:

Try to think about another title rather than the one provided by DQ. You have to practice creating attractive titles
You have some typos, correct them
When you deleted row 10472, you didn’t provide a link to the discussion where this necessary was claimed
When you select apps with the highest number of reviews for iOS and Android, your code is almost identical in both cases. Do you think it’s possible to write a function to avoid repetitiveness?
It’s not clear why you sum up all values in [42]

Sometimes your code style is not the same (like in [46] you don’t have spaces after the commas). You can use Jupyter Lab Formatter to automatically adjust your code to the same style
Are you sure that the company has to build a Social Networking App? Won’t it compete with FB, Instagram, and TikTok? There are few very popular social networks that monopolized the market and it’s very hard to get into it at the moment

Hi @daryaholodova! Thanks for sharing yet another project with the Community:) I liked that you clearly stated the two questions you want to answer at the end of the analysis. You’ve also done a great analysis without writing too much: your sentences are short and only summarize the most important insights you’ve discovered. Also, great job in digging in more capillary age groups (that’s interesting that you’ve found this difference among you people) although are samples big enough?
Some feedback from my side:

How this information can be useful to readers/employees? State it in the beginning. It can also be something like: this is curious to know the differences between new and veteran employees!
You have some typos
There are some Python style discrepancies. You can use Jupyter Lab/Notebook Formatter and a linting tool (like Black)
When you print out the data don’t forget to have a line explaining what that  data means to improve the readability. Something like: First five rows of the dataset, etc.
Improve your plots: title them, provide labels to axes, remove legendas where they are not needed, reorder categorical variables in a logical way (from New to Veteran). You can also increase the font size of plots’ labels by using seaborn.set_context (seaborn.set_context — seaborn 0.11.2 documentation).
I see the difference of your results with other projects for the DETE data set. This may happen because you select all column by using .iloc instead of manually selecting the columns you need. Make sure that you’ve selected [""job_dissatisfaction"", ""dissatisfaction_with_the_department"", ""physical_work_environment"", ""lack_of_recognition"", ""lack_of_job_security"", ""work_location"", ""employment_conditions"", ""work_life_balance"", ""workload""]

What’s the point of your last plot? Does it confirm your hypothesis that sex and job dissatisfaction are not correlated?

    train_set = df.iloc[:split_loc].copy()
    test_set  = df.iloc[split_loc:].copy()
    
    # model building
    model = KNeighborsRegressor()
    model.fit(train_set[[feature_col]], train_set[target_col])
    predictions = model.predict(test_set[[feature_col]])

Star Wars Survey: feedback welcome!,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-feedback-welcome/556709/4,"
Hi @jasperquak,
Really nice project here! You’ve written a good introduction explaining the context of the data and what you hope to achieve with it. The structure of your project is well-organised and easy to follow with appropriate use of headings and subheadings. Coding style is also tidy and well-commented!
A few suggestions from me:

Before uploading your notebook, it’s best practice to re-run the notebook as it ensures the code can run entirely without issue, and it’s a bit tidier too as all cells will start from [1], instead of [227] in this case
Consider a more captivating/less vague project title than ‘Star Wars Survey’, remember we want something eye-catching for the audience!
In cell [256] where you output a large sample of the dataset, it takes up a fair amount of vertical space, and it’s not immediately obvious to the reader the conclusions that you draw underneath – it might improve readability to breakdown the sample into the conclusions you draw, e.g.
– “Many people reported that they only saw some of the movies …”
< display a few lines from the sample that support this conclusion >
– ""People that saw a subset of the movies, in most cases … ""
< display a few lines from sample that support this conclusion >
– A quicker alternative could be to put the text for your examples in bold, e.g. ‘Example row 81’ so it’s more eye-catching, (and include an example for each bullet!)
In cells [255] [261] and [264], you use very similar code to create a plot – there’s an opportunity to reduce redundancy here by writing a function
– same for plots in cells [269] and [273] - I know the code is only used twice, but it’s quite a few lines so you could save a good amount of space here!

Overall, super work! Hope you find my suggestions useful

Have gone through it and it looks pretty good. The codes have been well worked and  has  thus rendered good output. The findings are very encouraging , keep it up mate for the good work.
Have got few humble suggestions to make;

Kindly recheck  your objectives, I think your  third point shouldn’t be part of  the listings.
You have hardly used the comments,  remember it’s  the comments that eases complex code lines. and when giving these comments always try to have them before the codes and not after the way you have done in cell [552]

Your findings in your last workings are very profound, and  I think it would be more better to have them wrapped in a subheading . When  workings on these subheading  try to make them a bit large , having them only bolded is not enough.

Otherwise congratulations  mate for the good work.
Happy learning.

Hi @linxjanabi
Thanks for sharing your project with Dataquest community. Have gone through it , and it looks pretty well. The code lines are well taken care of and has thus rendered relevant output. The whole project is well arranged into subheading  making it very easy to follow through the workings.Keep it up mate for the  good work.
Have got  few suggestions to make;

You need to do something on the title.  Have checked through and have found that other than user ratings, there are other aspects you have analyzed like most popular app by genre and so on, so to avoid biasedness of the title  always try to generalize, to ensure every detailed  is captured with not more than 15 words.
Also in the introduction , you ought to have added the links of the dataset you have used, and also giving some information background of these datasets.
You have hardly used the comments, remember it’s through the comments where the reader will  somehow understand some of the code  lines that might appear complex.
Consider adding some explanations in  every subheading you make

Otherwise congratulations for having completed your first project. All the best in your upcoming projects.  You can click  here to find more tips on how to style  up data science projects.

GP: Exploring eBay car sales data with pandas,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-with-pandas/556481/6,"
Hello @daryaholodova! Thanks for sharing your first project with the Community:) I read through the project and I’d said that it’s well organized and you always come straight to the point. Your conclusions are very short which is very important for a reader who wants useful information as quickly as possible.
Some suggestions from my part:

Avoid heading’s numbering, it only distracts the reader’s attention
Come up with some more attractive subheadings in the Data Cleaning part or remove them at all, right now there are very long and add only little useful information
Avoid too obvious code comments like “#Checking the result”  in [3]
Pay attention to the warning in [7]
Have you checked what percentage of entries with the price of 0 you’d removed?
In “Damaged cars prices” it’s not immediately clear what “no” and “yes” mean
In “Conclusions”, you can explain why more expensive cars, in your opinion, have higher numbers on the odometer

That’s it! Happy coding and good luck with your next project

thanks for share,


maybe this is just me and please do some research on it, but I think you do way to much commenting on the code (sometimes its 1 line of comment per 1 line of code) .eg. creating an empty list doesn’t need a comment,  all the details inside the loop also don’t need a comment (again that’s my opinion), I would just use 1 line comment to explain the whole loop , thats it.


I’d put all my imports at the top, like mentioned here:

Hello @lekanestyve! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:)
You have a nicely structured project and your explanations are very clear. Also, the code follows one excellent style!
Some feedback:

Correct typos and add full stops at the ends of all sentences
It depends on your goal but didn’t you want to make the project a bit more “professional” by avoiding colloquial language?
When you select a country with an above-average population and below-average area, you also included Antarctica which may have a big impact on the results.  Is this what you wanted to do?
Here you just present the data and sometimes comment on it but don’t you want to add more detail about the results?
Add conclusions and/or summary at the end of the project where you wrap up all the results

That’s it for me! Happy coding

Hi @tgusciora! Thanks for sharing your project. I liked that you attempted to comment on the code, which is very important for the reproducibility and readability. Well done on recommendations, they are very short and straight-to-the-point, often conclusions and recommendations are there only things a user reads in the project.
A few suggestions from my side:

Try to add a bit more title sections (like the first one could be “Data Cleaning”)
Explain why you make the project’s choices: why do you delete entry 10473? Why do you delete non-English apps and games? Why do you choose only free apps?, etc…
Make sure you follow the same code style along the project. It’s also better if you adhere to “official” Python guidelines (using PEP-8, or Black, etc.
Have a look at this style guide, it will help you greatly improve your project by making a few modifications
Divide the code into logical blocks (just one empty line between blocks of code will greatly improve readability)
You attempted to use docstring, that’s great! But have a look at  how they are  written correctly here. And have a look at pandas GitHub, they have excellent documentation of functions by using docstrings

Correct typos
Limit the number of displayed output rows, you only need the first few ones to get the most important data

This is it for me. Happy coding and good luck for your next projects

Hi @Bhagyashree
Thanks for sharing your project with Dataquest Community.  The links are now working and I am now able to get through your project and honestly the project looks really cool. The  introduction , the aim , use of comments, the explanation given in the markdown cell, have been well worked and well presented.
I love the way you have managed the data cleaning process, like the workings in cell[9] is just excellent, identifying the row  with missing data and printing its index  is very informing.
Same applies to how you have styled your workings and most of the explanations, the entire project  is just  admirable. Have also noticed how you have named most of your functions,  they look  short but relevant, keep it up mate for the good work.
Have got few suggestions/observation to make;

In confirming whether  App Store had a row with a missing data, that is in cell[12], I think you ought  to have added some strings  when the condition evaluates to true or false, having a blank display just because the condition evaluated to False, is not that very good  approach.
You need  to do more in your conclusion, remember you indicated  in the introduction that  your aim was to help the  developers understand what type of apps attract more users, so  you ought to have recommended on these apps in the conclusion.
You can delete  code cell[41], considering you have commented every single code in that code cell,  I don’t see it  having a great impact in your project.
You don’t need to add Guided Project as a title.

Otherwise congratulations mate for the good presentation.

Hello @adam.kubalica! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:)
I think you have a nicely structured project with nice insights. You are also the first one I’ve ever reviewed to notice that the data after 2015 is faulty which is great. Also good use of  geopandas and generally a nice approach to challenging yourself.  You’ve done a great job!
A few suggestions from my side:

Title your project
I think, it’s better to get rid of the index. It does not add that much information and the project starts to seem as a doctoral thesis
Remove too obvious comments like “#list the existing column names:” in cell [853]
Rerun the whole project so the cells have numbers from 1
In the section “Now lets loop over every brand:” you miss a code cell
Title your plots, label the axes and remove the top and the right spines. It will greatly improve the readability. You can do even more if you will read some articles on how to improve your plots (but I recommend a book called “Storytelling with data”
You should limit the number of brands on the pie chart to 5-6 and put all other brands in the “Other brands” category. It will improve the readability
You should provide a link to the map you used in the project (the .shp file)
Write conclusions! Many people who’ll read your project only care about those 10-15 lines that sum up the whole project. What are the main insights from the data set?

That’s it for me. Happy coding

Nice one, I wonder if we can prove the idea that we should be going after markets with Null values. (no competition, and growth potential). I wonder how the data would look if we’d :


check the mean of age value for rows with null values,

I love how you have worked out most of your functions ,   and  the  visualization process, the whole staff is admirable. Keep it up mate for the good work.
Have got  a humble suggestion to make;

Always consider giving explanations  when you are exploring on a new concept , like in cell [13], I  noticed that you were normalizing the  the columns, a  better approach is to introduce the reader why you are doing so. Adding  more comments can also help out in such situations.
Consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of the code cells.
You can delete the last code cell, being that it is empty , it serve no purpose in your project.

Otherwise , congratulations for  having completed the guided project on Predicting car prices.
Happy learning.

Hello @dadp2551! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. I hope my feedback may still be useful. You have overall a good project with neat observations and good conclusions.
Here are some suggestions:

Write down what questions you want to answer in the introduction
Title subheading with more attractive names not just dry “Pandas, Scatter Plots”
Try to comment after each plot and not at the end so the reader does not need to go back in forth  trying to connect the text and plots
In the “Pandas, Bar Plots” section, remove the legend “ShareWomen”  and instead title the x axis. Do the same for “Unemplyment_rate”
Title y axes on “Exploring the distributions of median salaries and the unemployment rate” plots
Title Density in Scatter Plots

You can greatly improve your visualizations. I can recommend reading the “Storytelling with Data” book.
You can also read this guide  on how to improve the project’s style.

Hi Ali!
Excuse me for long answer, but I was very busy looking for possible interest bug in the Tensorflow. Open ticket in the Tensorflow - wait answer about decision possible bug .
I saw you project. On other hand nice work, but other hand if you filling NaN value by mean - you get a beautiful in appearance but unreliable result.
I read the “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models” by Kjell Johnson, select 26 features from AMES dataset using mutual analyze and apply Ridge and Lasso - but my bellyful model it was equal R2 = 0.39 only in one feature - “square” and then it simply diverged starting from the second parameter it had a minus sign. I spent one week - but he model did not converge.
My IMHO in the future - don’t use mean/min/max - its distorts the real possible data rules - or delete its, or use knn neighbors or other - see book above.
Do not complicate the entities beyond what is necessary - use the Okama rule.
Keep in mind that ML and DL like search for a black cat in a black room without light where there is no cat, there is a solid empiricism here.
Congratulation!

Hi @dadp2551,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! You’ve done a great job: the project is well-structured, your storytelling is laconic but clear and informative, the graphs are cool and clean, with a good choice of colors and sizes. I liked your findings on speed limit adjustment in 2017. Also, well done on doing the extra steps!
Some suggestins:

You can consider creating functions for the plots of the same type, to avoid code repetition.
A good idea is to import all the libraries in the 1st code cell.
When the  project is already ready, it’s better to re-run it to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Consider removing the grids and unnecessary spines from your graphs. Also, it’s better to remove the x-axis label “Months” since it’s quite evident.
A good practice is to put in backticks column names and variables mentioned in markdown.

Hope my suggestions were helpful. Happy learning and good luck with your future projects!

Thanks for sharing your project with Dataquest community.  The project is well structured , with very well profound  steps . The background information about the database you have used , the links to access the database are very informing and nicely presented.  I love how  you have introduced most of your subtopics,  exploration of the outliers is just excellent . Your conclusion as well is very informing , keep it mate for the  good work.
Have got few observations/suggestion  to make;

I think you ought  to have allowed access to your queries  as well, having only the outputs displayed  can limit the reviewer who maybe could have wish to say something on the queries.
I  think you can also  expand your analysis to look for some demographic factors like the birth rate , death rate and so on,  and maybe give some observations . The database  have a lot to information to be discussed.
Have also noticed  some of your outputs  are missing explanations, like the one  in cell[19]. I think it could have turn out more better if  the reasons  behind its population was given.

rizvey.ma, hi!
My little notes:

MAE or RMSE are good parameters to find optimal values of different slopes or hyperparameters for Ridge or Lasso Regression.
But after predicting the y_pred  model for x_test  everybody in case linear regression must have get the R2 metrics - on the other hand, you have great values  MAE or RMSE but on another hand you can instable and not convergence model with negative R2.
For check collinearity features among themselves your first neseccary step -  exclude y  values in our case SalePrice, and after it you plot correlation only between remaining features, no values that me want predict
Before plotting it would be nice to bring  everything features  to the same scale - here you read
6.3. Preprocessing data — scikit-learn 0.24.2 documentation
Then possible and correlation plot may be have different colors and values.
In general ames is a bad and hard choice for linear regression.
P.S If you can use Ridge or Lasso regression - use only StandardScaler…
Simple OLS Linear regression invariant for scaling.

PPS . Scaling may decrease collinearity features between each other - but models may not convergence.

I have read through it and I’d say it’s almost a flawless project:) I especially liked your reasoning about what the water-to-land ratio means. You were a really good analyst. I also liked that you quickly summarized the finding at the beginning of the project.
I have just a few suggestions:

I think it’s better to include “Setup Jupyter to use SQLite” under “Introduction”
Have you experimented with setting to bald the most important parts of your summary? Does it look better?
You may add some general information about the countries/territories you’ve mentioned in the project. Especially, about the Pitcairn Islands:)

That’s it for me:) You have a very nice project (especially for the water-to-land reasoning) and I think it should be rewarded with a Community Champion badge  What do you think @nityesh?

Thanks for sharing your guided project documentation. I really like the structure and the content.
As to some of your questions, regarding the quick results printing vs storing results in objects, I prefer storing in objects as it is easy for reference at a later stage. And also makes your documentation easy as well.

I hope my feedback is still relevant. I read through the project and I think it has a good structure. Also, conclusions are very short and straight-to-the-point which is important to the readers who do not want to spend time reading the entire project:)
Here are some suggestions:

In the first code cell your comment says that you’re opening “Google Play dataset”. Did you confuse it with the “Profitable Apps” GP?
Consider limiting the number of subheadings and making them less descriptive. Instead, you may create bigger sections “Data Cleaning”, “Data Analysis” (or something more attention-grabbing) and try to split them in smaller sections but not too small (down to a single thing that you’re doing there)
Import all libraries in the first code cell. It’s easier to understand which libraries you’re working with
Comment the code. It will be easier for future you and readers to understand what it does
You have some typos
As I said, it’s better to include all calculations in the “Analysis”

SInce it’s the first project, it’s OK to have tecnhical description of functions/code in Markdown. However, for the future projects, try to concentrate on storytelling and leave technical stuff in code cells
Comment on your code, explain what it does. Sometimes, it’s not obvious:) You can use docstrings to explain what each function does and what parameters it requires
Limit the length of the output, the most important things are almost always at the top of the list

I think, that’s it. It is an excellent project and I think it may be showcased in the Community Champion contest! What do you think @nityesh?
Happy coding @dadp2551!
P.S. I also saw that you greatly improved in your latest project  Well done

Exploring Hacker News,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/exploring-hacker-news/556100,"
Hi @gaurav_taskar!
Thanks for sharing your project here! This is a great way to get helpful feedback on your project, and I have even learned skills outside the scope of what DataQuest teaches as a result!
First, I want to compliment your efficiency in working through the project. It seems like you cover a lot of ground in a relatively short document.
It also looks like you have the right approach to all the answers in your project. Most of the comments I have are about readability. There’s a nice quote about code readability, but I forget the exact wording, so here’s a paraphrased/butchered version:

Write your code so that someone can understand it 12 months from now, because that person will probably be you.

You can click on the collapsed sections below to look at the individual recommendations I have.


Use Python f-strings to simplify string formatting
@Elena_Kosourova introduced me to  Python f-Strings when I shared my first project. They are a powerful way to simplify your string formatting so that you do not have to define ‘template’ strings for each output.
For example:
template = ""Average comments on ask posts are ""
print(template + str(avg_ask_comments))

Can be reexpressed as:
print(f'Average comments on ask posts are {avg_ask_comments}') 




Add in-block comments and spacing to clarify individual code operations
When I took a look at your code, I was intimidated by the larger blocks of code that I saw. Take In[13], for example:
result_show_list = []
for post in show_posts:
    created_at = post[6]
    num_points = int(post[3])
    result_show_list.append([created_at, num_points])

print(result_show_list[0:5])

count_show_posts = {}
points_show_posts = {}
date_format_show = '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M'
for row in result_show_list:
    date = row[0]
    points = row[1]
    date_final = dt.datetime.strptime(date, date_format_show)
    time = date_final.strftime('%H')
    if time in count_show_posts:
        count_show_posts[time] += 1
        points_show_posts[time] += points
    else:
        count_show_posts[time] = 1
        points_show_posts[time] = points

points_show_posts
count_show_posts

I had to walk through your code line-by-line to understand what each block of code was doing, which made it more difficult to review how you approached the problem. Adding a few comments and visually breaking up code into functional chunks could help both you (and future co-workers) understand your reasoning. For example, here is how I would approach documenting your In[13]
# Collect and print a list containing the number of points for share posts by time-of-day posted.
result_show_list = []
for post in show_posts:
    created_at = post[6]
    num_points = int(post[3])
    result_show_list.append([created_at, num_points])
print(result_show_list[0:5])

# Gather time and point data and accumulate the values to the appropriate list.
count_show_posts = {}
points_show_posts = {}
date_format_show = '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M'
for row in result_show_list:
    date = row[0]
    points = row[1]
    date_final = dt.datetime.strptime(date, date_format_show)
    time = date_final.strftime('%H')
    
    # Check if the current time exists in our list. 
    #     Create it if necessary, otherwise, add the new value to the existing list.
    if time in count_show_posts:
        count_show_posts[time] += 1
        points_show_posts[time] += points
    else:
        count_show_posts[time] = 1
        points_show_posts[time] = points

# Display results
points_show_posts
count_show_posts




Vectorize similar assignment statements
This is a small comment, but in some cases it can make your code easier to read.
When you have very similar assignment statements right next to each other:
 date = row[0]
comment = row[1]

You can vectorize the code to be one line:
[date, comment] = [row[0], row[1]]




Include additional markup cells to help with project flow
As an outside reader, it can be challenging to follow someone’s thinking when only looking at their code. Using markup cells is a great way to help people step through your project without having to walk through code line-by-line. In particular, I am thinking about how you list the primary questions of the project in the first markup cell but then do not call out which of your cells answer which question.

I want to stress that you did a good job with this project. As far as I can see, you thought through the problems correctly and got the right answers. I hope that these comments are not too overwhelming. If you have any questions, I would be happy to talk more!

Exploring eBay Car Sales - Lekane Styve,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/exploring-ebay-car-sales-lekane-styve/555546,"
Hi @lekanestyve! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:) I hope my feedback is not too late. I think you have a good project with clear goals and a good structure. You also have very short conclusions that allow readers to quickly grasp the most important outcome of the project.
Some suggestions (some of them were already mentioned in the feedback for your 4th project):

Avoid too obvious code comments like # import pandas and numpy

In “Introduction” you did not complete Markdown for the link to data.world
It’s better to avoid too much description of technical parts of the project (like which data types are in the data set) and concentrate on story-telling
You say that you want to get rid of the prices below 0$ but there are not any!
It’s better to have less subheadings. Like, I don’t think “Next, let’s look at the ondometer column.” or "" Function to convert dates into a uniform numeric data for easier manipulation"" can be useful in the project’s structure
Why are you so conservative about the registration year? I suppose, there can be some old cars sold even at a higher price than the newer ones
Comment the code. It’ll be useful to future you and the readers  You can also use docstring to explain what the project’s functions do. But make sure that you do not write too obvious code like #Converting mean price into a series object.

You have some small typos and style issues (like, make sure that the names of car brands begin with a capital letter)
When you print(price_diff) consider adding some text to the string to explain what this number means

That’s it for me! Happy coding:)

Guided Project 4 - indicators of heavy traffic on I-94,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-4-indicators-of-heavy-traffic-on-i-94/556054,"
Hi @midlourenco!
Thanks for sharing your project here. Overall, I really like the way that you structured the project. Your use of numbering (3, 3.1, 3.2…), particularly in the data cleaning section, made it very easy to follow along with your thought process.
One suggestion I have is that in your plotting cells (specifically In[47] and In[48]), you have a lot of repetitive code. When you find yourself writing code a number of times with only slight variations, it is often a good opportunity to write a function to perform the repetitive action. As an example, here is the ‘repetitive’ part of In[47]:


Original code
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
by_hour_workingday_n[""traffic_volume""].plot.line()
plt.title(""Average traffic volume by hour of working day 7pm to 0am"")
plt.grid(True, linewidth= 1, linestyle=""--"")
plt.ylabel(""Average traffic volume"")
plt.ylim(0,6300)
plt.xlim(19,23)

plt.subplot(2,2,2)
by_hour_workingday_n[""traffic_volume""].plot.line()
plt.title(""Average traffic volume by hour of working day 0am to 7am"")
plt.grid(True, linewidth= 1, linestyle=""--"")
plt.ylabel(""Average traffic volume"")
plt.ylim(0,6300)
plt.xlim(0,7)


plt.subplot(2,2,3)
by_hour_weekendday_n[""traffic_volume""].plot.line()
plt.title(""Average traffic volume by hour of weekend day 7pm to 0am"")
plt.grid(True, linewidth= 1, linestyle=""--"")
plt.ylabel(""Average traffic volume"")
plt.ylim(0,6300)
plt.xlim(19,23)

plt.subplot(2,2,4)
by_hour_weekendday_n[""traffic_volume""].plot.line()
plt.title(""Average traffic volume by hour of weekend day 0am to 7am"")
plt.grid(True, linewidth= 1, linestyle=""--"")
plt.ylabel(""Average traffic volume"")
plt.ylim(0,6300)
plt.xlim(0,7)


What I see here is that in each subplot, you are performing many of the same actions:

Setting a title with a start and end hour.
Setting the format of the grid on your plot
Setting the ylabel as ‘Average Traffic Volume’
Setting the ylimit
Setting the xlimit

The way I would look at this is that there are three lines that are identical for each chart (2, 3, and 4), and two lines that are related in each chart (1 and 5). Because of this, you can simplify this to a function that takes in arguments for the xlimits, while performing lines 2, 3, and 4 automatically.


""plot_traffic_volume"" function
# line_data = series that you want to plot
# start_hour = beginning hour of the plot **in 24hr format**
# end_hour = end hour of the plot **in 24hr format**
def plot_traffic_volume(line_data, start_hour, end_hour):
    line_data.plot.line()
    plt.title(f'Average traffic volume by hour of weekend day {start_hour} to {end_hour}'
    plt.grid(True, linewidth = 1, linestyle = '--')
    plt.ylabel('Average traffic volume')
    plt.ylim(0,6300)
    plt.xlim(start_hour, end_hour)


With this function written, you can simplify the first code block above to:


Updated code
plt.figure(figsize = (12, 10))
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plot_traffic_volume(by_hour_workingday_n[""traffic_volume""], 19, 23)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plot_traffic_volume(by_hour_workingday_n[""traffic_volume""], 0, 7)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plot_traffic_volume(by_hour_weekendday_n[""traffic_volume""], 19, 23)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plot_traffic_volume(by_hour_weekendday_n[""traffic_volume""], 0, 7)


Hopefully that makes sense! Please let me know if you have any questions about it.

Request for Feedback for Investigating Fandango Movie Rating System,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/request-for-feedback-for-investigating-fandango-movie-rating-system/555735,"
Hi @rizvey.ma! Thanks for sharing your new project with the Community:) I liked it and I think you’ve improved greatly compared to your another project on eBay car sales. You have better defined the goal of the project and I liked how you described the approach before the coding part:)
Here are some suggestions:

As I said in your eBay project, it’s better to merge some heading like “Importing Libraries” and “Loading Datasets”
Code comments are good, although sometimes the description is a bit excessive like in code cell [32]. It’s not necessary to say that the method uses vectors to extract characters
When you check for the number of ratings, you should provide the link to the website where you collected this data
In code cell [45] be aware of SettingWithCopyWarning. It may indicate that you are doing something wrong and the results may be incorrect. Read more about this warning here

You used the fivethirtyeight style for the last plot. Why not use the same style for the first two plots? Otherwise, you’ll have to despine them, make axes labels bigger, and deal with skewed x-axis tick labels. Also, make sure that botht plots have the same figsize to allow an easier comparison
Set the important parts of the conclusions to bald


That’s it for me! Good luck with your future projects, and happy coding

Guided Project Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Survey,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-survey/555727,"
Hello @gmpay1! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:) I liked that you thoroughly described each step.
However, here are my suggestions:

Title the project with a more appealing name. It’s meant also for people out of DataQuest. They do not know what Guided Project means!
You should avoid the space between print and what is printed. It’s not recommended if you want to follow Pythonic style guidelines
Leave out technical subheadings and squeeze them under a “Data Cleaning” (or similar) heading. You may leave the most important things you’ve done as level-3 heading (like, “Identify Missing Values and Drop Unnecessary Columns”)
Don’t print out long lists of  output by the value_counts() and info() methods.  I believe, they only create a distraction
In the section “New Column Names”, it’s not clear when you did this renaming process. It took me some time to understand, that it was done before. You did the same in ""Combine the dataframes. Try to be more linear

In code cell [18] you’ve complicated your life so much! Try to write a function that does the age categorization. You’ll that it’s much easier than doing this manually
You drop all columns where the number of NaN values is greater than 500 but give no explanation of why you did it
Use plt.show() to avoid the printing of the additional information (like matplotlib.axes....)
Title the plots, it’s not clear what they are
Also make sure that you label all the axes to make it clear what are the numbers on them
Order the categories on the “service_cat” plot in a logical way (from “New” to “Veteran”)
It’s not necessary to use %matplotlib inline two times
Provide a short summary at the end of the project. Have you been able to answer the questions? What are the results?

That’s it for me. Happy coding

My 2nd Python project: Exploring Hacker news posts,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-2nd-python-project-exploring-hacker-news-posts/555955,"
Hi @aashaydabli96! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:) I liked that you described what HackerNews is about, left the link to the data set, and adapted the project to your time zone in the conclusions.
Here are my suggestions:

Import all libraries in the first code cell. It will make the code more organized, especially if you need to import more than 3-4 libraries
What are the project’s goals? Readers find it out only in the conclusions. You have to state them early in the project to guide readers through the project
I believe, you should limit the number of sections or at least create a more organized project’s hierarchy (like having all Data Cleaning things under the level 2 heading, and then level 3 subheadings under Data Cleaning)
Following, the last point, it’s better to write technical things from subheadings (like "" Finding the amount of Ask HN posts and comments by hour created"" as code comments:)
You should also better organize the code you write. Split for loops (newline between them). Do the same for all logical parts of your code! I’m not sure if it’s advised by PEP8 but it will make the code look cleaner
In conclusions, set to bald only the important parts. What the reader should pay attention to?

Some of the above I had already said in your project on “Profitable apps” here.
I hope, my suggestions are helpful. Happy coding and good luck with your future projects:)
"
Sharing my first guided project: Profitable Apps,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/sharing-my-first-guided-project-profitable-apps/555794,"
Hello @babiryedaphne! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community:)
You have clearly defined the project’s objectives and thoroughly describe the technical part of your work. However, here are some suggestions:

Change the title to something more attractive! It should briefly summarize the project’s objective and (if you wish) the results. This way, it will make potential readers at least look at it and it’s your first win
You remove the entry 10473 from the Google Play dataset two times in cells [5] and [8]. Moreover, you do not explain why you did
Do not include the technical description in Markdown cells. Instead, you can use can use code comments or docstrings, like in the section “Criteria for determining profitable Apps : Data Analysis”
You have some style inconsistencies (like a lot of bold text where you describe the function language(). Also, make sure that you do not have any additional spaces before and after the code like in cells [20]
I think, you should also limit the length of the output like in cells [21] and [34]
Here (“From the analysis, the most popular apps are”) it’s better to use a bullet list
You forgot the conclusions which is arguably the most important part of the project

That’s it, happy coding

Guided Project CIA Factbook feedback,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-cia-factbook-feedback/555996,"
Hi @sudarshanawasthi47 !
Thanks for sharing your project here. I just posted my own version of the CIA Factbook SQL project, and I was excited to see how other folks approached it. One of the first things that I noticed when I saw your project was that you use your headers to effectively organize your project. It makes it a lot easier to scan the entire document when there are those visual anchors.
I found it a bit more challenging to scan your code cells. I would encourage you to take a look at the SQL Style Guide, particularly the section on white space. They recommend that you organize the code not based on 4-space indents (like we do in python), but rather with right justification of each command For example:

Python style indentation
def a_function(foo):
    for i in range(len(foo)):
        bar[i] = foo[i] + 2
    return bar


SQL style indentation
SELECT foo, bar
  FROM data
 WHERE data > 0
 ORDER BY bar

The style guide calls it a ‘river’ running down the center of your query, which makes it easy to ID commands at a glance.
Hopefully that is a helpful suggestion!

Hi @markstewart1975! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. I liked reading through the project and wanted to point out your throrough description of the project’s steps. You also provided a clear motivation to recommend an innovative game for both markets.
Moreover, you understood that although Social Network, Music, and Reference categories may be very popular, they are dominated by giant players.
Here are my suggestions:

Comment the code, especially describe what the functions do. You can use docstrings for these. There are many ways of how to describe them. You can refer to numpy/pandas code because they have an excellent code documentation.
Split the code using new lines (i.e. between 2 for loops.). It’ll make the code clearer
Import modules outside functions. It’s better for the readability
Add paragraphs (at least, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, and Conclusions)
Set the most important parts of each text block to bald (especially, in conclusions)
Limit the length of output lists to the top 5-10. It’ll make it easier to grasp the most useful information
You did not explain why you deleted the entry 10473 from the Google data set
Explain why you remove non-English apps
Do not explain the code in Markdown cells (or at least, limit it to the minimum) like you did when explaining the duplication removal. It’s better to use code comments  I know that it may be useful for your understanding to write everything down but try to avoid it in the future projects. Markdown cells have to tell the story, not to explain the code.

That’s it for me, good luck with your future projects! Happy coding

Hi @YoussefAlaaEtman,
WOW !! Seriously amazing !
I love your angle and the plot gif you made is obviously beyond expectation.
On the first plot I also really like how you show which direction equals the stronger dollar or euro.  Such a good idea that really makes it easier to quickly absorb the information in the plot gif.
Your code is really clean and well organized making it easy to read which is also fantastic.
The only suggestion I can think of is adding a title to the 2nd plot such as “Events Impacting Strength of EUR Against the US Dollar”.  You explained it well in the introduction but you might need to add it to the plot for the figure to stand alone.
Great job and well worth the effort you put into it!!

Hi Alexei,
Welcome back to the Community with another awsome project! You’ve done a great job applying both manual approach and scikit-learn classifier, and you even obtained a higher accuracy in that your experiment. Your code is clean and perfectly commented, the storytelling is really cool, with all the necessary links, mathematical references, and emphasizing the most important points. Well done!
Some minor suggestions:

You can combine the adjacent code cells if they have no output or markdown cells in between(e.g. [12]-[13], [17]-[18], [19]-[20], [21]-[22]).
Right before the code cell [16], something happened in the last sentence in markdown (selecting alpha).
You can create the classify function without that intermediate step.
Consider rounding outputs for the accuracy values  in both cases. It’s especially easy since you’re using f-string formatting, which is great.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Good luck with your future projects and keep up this high level!

Hacker News Worthy,14,https://community.dataquest.io/t/hacker-news-worthy/550842,"
Hi Bruce,
Now I’ve reviewed your project. It looks really cool! Very profound data analysis, great idea to dig deeper, and great direction of digging: checking the most popular hours by day of week. I liked also your way of reasoning and all the observations and conclusions in markdown. Emphasizing the most important ideas is also a good practice. Ah, and also good idea to use pretty-printing (I mean, adding ---- to print small subtitles with print()). Well done!
What I would  suggest to you:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s already completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
I noticed that you used too many quote marks in markdown explanations, for many words all around the project. Probably you might consider to remove some 

The code cell [108]: it’s enough to print only the rounded results: Average Rounded Ask Comments and Average Rounded Show Comments

There is one paragraph repeated twice: the first time after the subheadings ’ “Ask HN” and “Show HN” Totals’ (except for the first line), the second - after this one ’ “Ask HN” vs “Show HN” Comments’. I would suggest to you to remove the first one, since this paragraph actually describes the results of the code cell [108], which occurs further on.
You can consider putting the technical details related to the code itself as short comments inside the relevant code cells (especially in long code cells), while leaving all the observations and explanations of the results in the markdown cells.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Congratulations on having done a nice project!

Hi Gaurav,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your project with us. Your work looks really nice and easy-to-follow, and I especially liked your laconic but informative explanations and observations throughout the project. Great job!
Some suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s completed to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
When mentioning variable names, column names, dataframes etc. in markdown, consider using backticks (``) for better emphasis.
Avoid unnecessary empty lines in your code cells (e.g. in 15])
Probably, it’s better to add more code comments (but not too many )
You made very well rounding the output for the code cell [21], consider doing the same for [23] and [28].
The code cell [26]: the output looks too long. You might consider showing only the most popular categories.

Hope my suggestions were useful. Good luck with your future projects!

Thanks for sharing your third  project with Dataquest community. The whole project looks pretty  good with code lines well managed and has thus rendered good outputs. The aim is well defined  and the  comments  are well worked  and well detailed. Most of  your explanations are very informing, keep it up mate for the good work. Have  got few humble suggestions to make;

always consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of the code cell.
It’s also advisable to give the link of the dateset you are and providing some details/explanations or rather the information background about  this dataset.
Since you aid an aim in your  project, It’s advisable to summarize some of your findings and provide  a subtopic/sub title like ‘conclusion’
Your can consider having the workings in cell[7], in single line of code to avoid to much repetition  and it will as well save time and space.

Otherwise congratulations for the good work  and for the  presentation.
Happy Learning!

Hi Vadim,
Thanks for sharing another great project with the Community. For sure, currently you’re the fastest learner on the platform and, at the same time, the quality of your projects really is impressive! Great job using both lasso and linear regressions and especially interesting observations and conclusions from this comparison. Clean code and efficient code commenting, excellent function documentation, informative background information in the introduction, all the necessary links, including those on the additional resourses. Ah, and I liked your cool cover picture! 
A few suggestions from my side:

Please increase numbers, labels, legends, and titles on your plots, they are too small for now. Otherwise, the plots themselves look great.
The code cell [5]: consider creating a function for close column for different number of days.
The code cell [6]: it’s better to add a short title to each table.
The code cells [7]-[10]: separate better the output tables (adding empty lines between them). Otherwise, for now, each title seems to be attached to the end of the previous table.
Always add an empty line before each code comment to enhance code readability.
The code cell [12]: here maybe it’s better to create a function for these plots to avoid code repetition.
Be careful of typos.

Hope my feedback was helpful. Keep up this fast learning and high quality level!

Exploring Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/exploring-heavy-traffic-indicators-on-i-94/555619,"
Hi @lekanestyve,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. You’ve done a good job! Interesting observations, smooth storytelling, clear project goal, all the necessary links are present, cool emphasizing of the most important things. Also, I liked that you put a table with column names in a comprehensible form at the beginning of the project.
Some suggestions from my side:

When the project is already completed, don’t forget to re-run it to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Avoid too obvious code comments, e.g. # importing the required libraries, # Read the dataset.
You might consider rounding the outputs of the code cells [119], [129], [134], [147].
Since you create several plots of different types, you can create a function for each plot type to avoid code repetition.
To increase data-ink ratio of your visualizations, consider removing redundant elements from them: spines, ticks, in some cases even axis labels (e.g. from the plots from [160] and [161] you can remove y-axis labels). Always add a title to each plot. Add axis labels if they are necessary.
The code cell [163]: you can add the parameter alpha  to tune the point transparency.
The code cell [114]: remove empty lines.
Conclusion: you have the number 1 repeated twice in the main list, please fix it

I hope my suggestions were useful. Happy learning!

Sharing my first guided project: First Project,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/sharing-my-first-guided-project-first-project/555598,"
Hi @hwaasi,
Welcome to the Community and thank you for sharing your first project with us. Your code is clear and easy-to-read, and also I liked that your conclusion is non-conventional (usually people write here about a popular book).
Some suggestions from my side, hopefully useful:

Don’t forget to add a link to the dataset in the introduction.
It’s better to re-run the already ready project to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
You put the aim of your project after the code cell [33]. I’d suggest you to put it at the beginning of the project. Also, since the aim and goal means the same, consider combining those 2 paragraghs into one.
You might consider combining adjacent code cells into one, if they have no output or markdown cells between them (e.g. [2]-[4], [30]-[33]).
There are some empty not-run code cells in the project, please remove them.
Avoid too technical subheadings (e.g.Creating a Function to Sort the Frequency Table), or converting common phrases into subheadings (e.g. I got this result).
Don’t leave any commented-out code in your project. Or uncomment it (if this code is necessary, e.g. in the code cell [14]), or remove it (if it’s not necessary).
It’s better to remove any unnecessary empty lines in the code cells (e.g. [20] and [48])
A good practice is to put any technical information about your next steps into code comments and not in markdown. The code comments should be as laconic as possible, ideally 1 relatively short line per each comment. In the markdown, instead, your should add your observations about the intermediate results and issues. By the way, consider adding more of such  observations in your project, to explain better what results we obtained at each step.
You  might consider rounding the outputs of code cells (e.g. [49], [50]).
The code cells [77], [79], [80], [81]: too long outputs. You can display only several rows, e.g. the most popular categories.
Avoid creating too long names of variables, such as Highest_avg_n_ratings_to_string Also, it’s better to start variable name from a small letter.

Hope my ideas were interesting. Good luck with your future projects!

Analyzing Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-heavy-traffic-indicators-on-i-94/555587,"
Hi Aditya,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. I liked your interesting observations throughout the project, great approach to emphasize the most important things, and doing some extra exploration of the data.
Here are some suggestions from my side:

When the project is already ready, it’s important to re-run it to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
A good practice is to import all the libraries in the 1st code cell.
There are some SettingWithCopyWarning in the project, I suggest you to fix them.
Be careful of typos.
Avoid too obvious code comments, e.g. # Import pandas library, # Creating ‘df’ DataFrame by using pandas. # Import matplotlib library to plot graph. Also, avoid adding an empty line after a code comment.
It’s better to combine adjacent code cells without any output or markdown explanations between them into one (the code cells [21]-[23], [31-33], etc.).
You can consider rounding output values (e.g. the code cells [42] and [45])
About visualizations:

Consider removing spines and ticks from the plots where they are not necessary.
Always add a title to a plot.
Since you have many plots of the same type, you might create a function for each plot type to optimize your code.
The code cell [57]. Instead of dividing the plot into 3 parts, probably it would be better to introduce vertical lines on the same plot and add the parameter alpha to regulate point transparency.
The code cells [64] and [66]: consider sorting the bars for better readability.



Hope my feedback was helpful. Happy coding!

Hi @kwu!
Well done on spotting this issue, I did this mistake in my GP on Star Wars. It would be good if DataQuest included this small note in the GP (or refer to the article). Maybe @nityesh may help?
As you said here this project is targeted to the community rather than future employees, and that’s good. I see that you learned a lot from the project:)
I liked your thorough explanations, code commenting, and robust data analysis but here is what can be improved:

Write down the questions you want to  answer to at the beginning of the project so the reader can have an idea of what to expect
You have some typos, you can use Grammarly to correct them:)
You can reduce the number of sections and merge ""Boolea-ting""s into a more general section like “Data Cleaning and Preparation”
Make sure to avoid the warnings (if a person uses future versions of pandas to run the notebook, that may cause problems)
I’m not sure what you do in the section "" Seen This Episode? Column Value Map"". Could you explain it?
In [37] you should not print the dataframe to have a nice format
It’s better to import all the modules in the first code cell
Do you use the seaborn library? Do not import anything just in case:)

Happy coding @kwu

Predicting Bike Rentals with Happenstance Data,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-bike-rentals-with-happenstance-data/555459,"
good job!
random forest does better because it captures better non-linear relationship are the kind of relationships that happen most in real life. Try to visualize through a scatter plot the dependent variable with the independent ones. Try to visualize the residuals as well and scatter them with independent variables as well to see if any one of them is highly correlated to the errors. If not, the omitted variables bias might mess your model which you took into account and there is not much you can do about it.
I would 46% R-squared is not too bad, but the error rate is concerning. Try to standardize your features.
Good luck!

Predicting House Sale Price (m240),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-house-sale-price-m240/555490,"
Hi Vadim,
Thanks for sharing another cool project with the Community! As usual, very detailed and profound data analysis, great approach to apply both linear and ridge regression and compare the results, clean and easy-to follow code and appropriate use of code comments. This time I also liked how you formatted outputs from the code cells and also your variable naming is efficient.
About calculating b(slope) and c(intersect) - good question! From my point of view I cannot see any error in your code, so I’d suggest you to open a ticket in Scikit-learn. Or maybe further reviewres will find some issues, but probably it’s better not to wait for them and create a ticket.
Some suggestions from my side:

I noticed that you didn’t create any functions. Since you have some long and repeated blocks in your code (such as defining optimal alphas, creating scatter plots, etc.), introducing corresponding functions would help you to significantly optimize it.
Dataviz: consider making titles and labels bigger, sometimes they are difficult to read.
Avoid too long and technical subheadings (such as Train and test using LinearRegression with Ordinary Least Squares and OneHotEncoder and RobustScaler encoder). You can always add explanations in markdown afterward.
You can import several modules in one line. For example, instead of these lines:

from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV

use this:
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, RidgeCV


Remove the commented out code from the code cell [1].
It’s better to add an empty line before a code comment to improve code readability (the code cells [4], [11], etc.)
To create a list of N zeros, use this piece of code: [0]*N


Hope my suggestions were helpful. Keep up this fast learning pace and high quality of projects!

Hi @rizvey.ma! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. I looked through the project and I liked that you have very neat bullet-listed observation after each code cell. They are very easy to read:)
I also liked that you left comments on your code that is very important for its undestanding (for other people but also future you!).
Also well done on using docstring in the function date_dist!
Here are some suggestions:

Clarify the objections of the project. What questions do you want to answer?
Some code is not commented, so it’s was not immediately clear what it does
You can limit the number of headings (like not need to separate “Loading dataset” and “Importing Libraries”
You can greatly improve docstring. You can see examples of it in pandas or numpy docs
You do not say anything about some things that you discover. Like what about crawling dates? We just see them but there are no comments from your part
Why do you exclude all cars under 100 dollars? I believe there will be some that might have a lower price
You analyze the top 6 brands but what do you want to know?
You do not say anything about the most popular models in the conclusions. Why?

That’s it for me! Happy coding

I love the way you have managed customize the the display of  most of the outputs ,the  listing (vertical display) is just excellent. Providing  the summary of the results in the introduction motivated me  further to get into the project  to confirm the same, and honestly I got satisfied 
Just a suggestion you ought to have added some inline comments to the workings in cell[11],  the code lines looks quite long and somehow complex, and by adding some comments would have make it more presentable.

I love most of your explanations they  are well detailed and very informing  , the stylings are just excellent, keep it up mate for the good work. Have got two suggestions;

Recheck on your graph on  cell[25], I think the labelling of the axes are  incorrect, actually you have labelled x-axis twice,  I gaze the second label was for y-axis .
I think  when providing the source of the datasets you have used and some of the background information of these datasets, the best practice is to have them on the introduction before any code line.

Otherwise  , Congratulations for having completed your third guided project!

It’s always advisable to provide the link of the dataset you are using.
Always consider having your work into subtopic,  and by doing so, take care not have them with the same fonts as the explanations  as you have done  in the conclusion , that subtopic(sub title) `conclusion’ need to be styled up . please check that out.

Depending on your background you can actually do a lot more, e.g.
-study the correlation between the variables
-slightly more advanced, analyse the interaction of the variables and the individuals with PCA (there is an excellent package for that in R, FactoMineR)
-finally, always write your conclusion, you could be wrong but how do we know?
Advice for the graphs: don’t put white background on scatterplots. You can plot many to many column comparison with the function ggduo() in the GGally library.

Have got few suggestions;

Always consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of the cells.
Consider providing the links of the dataset  you are using, for easy access  by the reader.
You haven’t provided any comments at all in your  workings.Remember comments somehow helps the reader to   understand the code lines more so those that might appear complex.
Consider styling the text presented in the markdown cell, having  the title  in same font with the texts( the clarification given below the title) is not  that good, you can read through this link for more clarifications.
Consider having subtopic in your workings.
Most of your outputs are overcrowded like in cell[6],consider spacing them up by using print(""\n""). You can also have vertical display by performing for loop, and by this , they will be more readable.
Your workings shows that ‘Ask Post’ has ‘0.0’ average  number of points per post, how then did  you come to a conclusion that  ‘Ask Post’ receive more   comments compared to ‘Show Post’? Kindly check those workings in cell[16].

You ought to have provided the links of the dataset you used, for easy access by the reader who might have an idea of getting to know more information about the dataset.
You have hardly  used the comments in your workings, Like  your first four functions could have been much better when accompanied with some inline comments.
As much as most of your outputs are self explanatory, you ought to have as well added some text/explanations  to some of those outputs.

Hello @jasperquak! Thanks for sharing your work with the Community:)
You have a well-structured project with a good description of the steps you’ve taken. You also commented on the code cells which is very important to help other people understand your code.
Here are some suggestions:

It’s better to tell us what the surveys are about and make some examples (like the quality of education,  safety, etc). You can also tell us your hypotheses about what you expect
Make sure to tell the readers what are the project’s objectives
You can limit the number of subheadings in the Data Preparation section but make sure that it’s still readable
You did not leave any code comment in the first section. Why?
Did you find something interesting while exploring the correlation between the SAT score and other measures? Could you tell us about your findings?
It’s better to import all the libraries in the first code cell to improve the project’s readability
Your plots do not have titles, and axes labels. I would also increase the size of tick labels and rename them to something clearer. Also, the plot of SAT scores by boro is very crowded with narrow bars and it’s extremely difficult to understand what it communicates. You’d also better limit the number of colors and u see less intensive color palette to make the plot more accessible to the reader’s eyes.
One of your images in the "" Correlation of SAT scores with survey results"" section does not load
I’d round values in tables to improve the readability

That’s it for me. Happy coding!

Hi @drill_n_bass,
Thank you for sharing your project with us and welcome back to the Community!  Wow, you project looks super-detailed, and you conducted a very thorough analysis!! I can imagine that the whole work took a lot of time. And you were absolutely right to include the previous analysis and cleaning sections into it, otherwise it would lack context.
Some suggestions from my side:

It’s important to re-run the whole project when it’s already ready, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
You should add a conclusion summarizing the main insights of your work.

Project structure. It’s better to put all the technical information, making it as laconic as possible, in code comments. In markdown, we should share only our observations and next steps (not technical but logical). For the same reason, a good idea is to avoid too technical chapter names (Seg 2, chapter 11). Also, for the very same reason, I would remove descriptions of pandas methods and the links to their documentation (your readers will google them by themselves, if they are curious, so don’t make their lives too easy ). As  for subheadings, I noticed that some of them are repeated even inside one segment up  to 3 times (for example, Filling in Missing Values). Also, you practically have 3 different introductions, one for each segment. I’d suggest you to fix these things

Technical issues. Some images and links (like the one for Flatbush) are not visualized, or visualized incorrectly. Also, there are some issues with displaying the tables in Segment 2, chapters 2, 6, and 8. And yes, I was checking your project from my Anaconda, because there is really something wrong with the tab, even after my adjustments.

Plots. You might consider despining them, de-ticking, adding readable (i.e. descriptive, laconic, and big enough) titles and axis labels.
About numbers before the subheadings. A good practice is to avoid them at all. However, since you have 3 different segments, you can consider adding double numeration. For example, Segment 3 chapter 2 will be numbered 3.2. Otherwise, the readers can be confused.

I hope my suggestions were helpful. Good luck with your future projects and happy learning!

I love how you have performed out  the cleaning process, like removing the duplicate data, the non-English  apps and so on , those workings are  so excellent, keep it up mate.
Have got few humble suggestions to make;

Always consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of the  cells.
Those other information like  providing the link of the dataset,  information background of the dataset(like  telling more about the number of rows)   can emerge better if they were presented in the introduction.
You ought to have pointed out the missing  column in row [10472], or even giving some clue on how to identify the column in more easier way,  for example if you check the value entered in the ‘rating’ column ,it’s 19 which is very wrong, because no rating value can exceed 5.
You can consider workings with boolean value in cell[14] though as alternative.

You ought to have included the conclusion( the findings in a summarized manner) at the end of your workings.
It’s always advisable to re-run your project for sequential ordering of the code cells.
I  can see  you first displayed the dataset after performing some cleaning process like the deletion , I think displaying some few rows before performing any work  is the best approach .
Also I think you ought to have given  a reason why you deleted row[10473], If you check keenly on the rating column, you will realize it’s indicated 19, which is wrong because ratings can’t exceed 5.

Predicting House Sale Price With Messy Data,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-house-sale-price-with-messy-data/555074,"
Hi Bruce,
It’s always a pleasure for me to review your interesting and detailed works  As your previous ones, this project is perfectly structured, has clear goals, all the necessary links, background information (this time, cool overview of data leakage and collinearity), interesting and coherent observations, clean and highly readable visualizations, and great cover picture. Also, very profound data analysis and at the same time fast learning pace.
Below are some comments from my side, mostly about minor technical details:

It’s better to put column names in backticks when mentioned in markdown.
Avoid too wordy and/or evident comments (# import a whole pile of key python libary, modules to execute various code commands. # use seaborn library to create boxplot, # adding a constant). In general, however, your code commenting is great and very informative.
Importing the libraries. These 2 lines:

from IPython.display import HTML
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

can be combined:
from IPython.display import HTML, display, Markdown

Also, throughout the project, I noticed that you imported several times the same libraries. For example, in the code cell [7], you again import matplotlib and seaborn, and starting from the code cell [20], you have many duplicated imports, most probably because of copy-paste issues. To avoid it, a good practice is to import all the libraries in the 1st code cell.

Be careful of typos.
The code cells [3], [6], [17], and [18]: you can add informative subheadings to the printed outputs and probably separate them in some way (e.g. an empty line).
It’s better to avoid naming dataframes or any other variables like df, df2, etc. A better choice is some meaningful, descriptive name. It can help to avoid confusion in future.
The code cells [5] and [14]: it’s better to add plt.show() to avoid unnecessary outputs.
The code cells [18] and [21]. Here I would add more code comments. Also, you might consider creating a function for the code in [18] to avoid code repetition.
You repeated by mistake the section about data leakage twice, after the code cells [4] and [24]. Probably, it’s better to remove the first occurence of it and keep the second.
Conclusion: here, you might consider focusing not on the working process and issues encountered, but rather on the insights obtained throughout the project. Also because your insights are really cool and meaningful, so it would be great to summarize the main points in the conclusion in a concise form.

Hope my suggestions were useful. Great job, Bruce, thanks for sharing!  And good luck with your future projects!

Predicting Car Prices (m155),3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-car-prices-m155/554907,"
Hi Vadim,
Congratulations on completing another cool project! I liked a lot of things: your curiosity to the data and especially to details, profound data analysis, doing extra steps, very well-structured and informative storytelling, the links to additional resources all around the project, using both r2-score and RMSE, clear highly readable and well-commented code, cool cover picture.
Some minor comments for your consideration:

You can download several functions from the same module at once, instead of dividing them into several rows. For example:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, cross_val_score


You forgot to add the link to the dataset documentation in the introduction (only the one to a direct downloading the dataset).
Avoid obvious code comments, like # Import required modules, # call KNeighborsRegressor object, # Fit model. Otherwise, your code commenting is perfect.
Avoid numbering the subheadings. In some cases, it can be confusing, especially when you have sub-division of sections.
For the feature selection, I’d suggest you to try all the numerical columns (and avoid all the others, like make and engine-type). For example, the feature engine-size seems to be unexpectedly strongly correlated with a car’s price. On the other hand, you can’t use the non-numerical columns for ML prediction, even though I totally agree with you, and my  common sense suggests it as well, that the make influences the price much more than the engine size  However, you cannot technically use the make for ML, while the engine size you can.
For all the code cells with several outputs ([3], [5], etc.):  it’s always a good idea to add internal subheadings for each output.
As for the information on mileage: you can  find it in the columns city-mpg and highway-mpg.
Visualizations: consider making the plot titles and labels bigger. Also, the legends for [6], [11], and [13] look a bit overwhelming, you can consider making them shorter.
The code cells [15] and [16]: the outputs here also look a bit overwhelming. You can consider making graphs instead, or alternatively rounding the output values. Also, it’s better to output, for example, “3 folds…” instead of “3 k-folds…”.
When you use a direct quotation from a source, you can find useful this technique in markdown.
In the conclusion, I’d add the following: which feature (or a feature combination) is the most helpful for the car price prediction in the ML algorithm?

Great job, Vadim, as usual. Good luck with your future projects and keep this fast and efficient pace of learning!

Hi Nathalia,
Thanks for sharing another cool work with the Community!  I’m a fan of your  projects, they are always precise, clear, informative, and easy-to-follow!  This time, I would like to especially highlight your interesting observations and efficient emphasizing of the most important points throughout the project, very cool idea to compare rain and snow throughout the year to capture the anomalies (usually people, myself included, are discussing here the potential road works, and your way of thinking is different and fresh), great code commenting, doing extra steps, and using nice features like centering pictures and showing all the columns. Also, visualizing the correlation is a much better idea than just showing it as a table. Well done!
Below are some suggestions from my part:

You might consider creating functions for similar plots (e.g. line plots, histograms, etc.).
Section 3: I’d add a couple of comments about the initial data exploration (e.g. number of columns and rows, missing values, data types).
Plots. It’s better to sort the bar plots to see their hierarchy. Also, I’d make the titles and labels bigger, customize axis labels (Traffic volume instead of traffic_volume), and despine the plots.
It’s better to avoid some obvious comments like # importing the file and reading it, # importing the libraries.
As for the conclusion, probably you can consider reducing the part about the nighttime, since it’s not a priority for the heavy traffic.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Keep up this high quality of work, and good luck with your future projects!

Predicting Car Prices or Not?,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-car-prices-or-not/554765,"
Hi @sbgraham72
Thanks for sharing another project on Predicting Car Prices  with the Dataquest’s community.
The general layout is very admirable, the code lines , the explanations given in the markdown cell , the visualization, the conclusion are very informing. I find it motivating that you have managed to work through the entire project in an organizable manner despite having some difficulties in K-nearest Neighbors Regression. Keep it up mate ! and with consistency in place, all shall be well.
Have got two humble suggestions;

You ought to have included the link of the dataset you have used for easy access by the reader. who may wish to explore on the dataset
Giving background information of the dataset you are using is very key when working  on any project, this make it easier for the reader to adapt with the dataset and the entire project as well, hope you will check onto that in your upcoming projects.

Otherwise keep it up mate for the good work. Wishing you all the best in upcoming projects.
Happy learning!

Congratulations on sharing your first project with the Community! It looks really awsome and it’s definitely very different from all the other projects I saw here on the same topic! Perfect project structure, all the necessary links are present, all the important moments empasized (with bullet poins and lists), great idea to introduce those functions, cool and even non-conventional function description. Well done, indeed!
As for your question, you can find very useful this guide:

Some suggestions from my side:


from csv import reader you can import it in the first code cell, together with the other libraries.
For displaying code cell outputs, you can use this new “high-tech” format:

I’d suggest you remove over-indexing in markdown (Q-1, A-1, numbered subheadings, especially with brackets). Also, it’s better to remove the questions from the introduction: just leave the answers themselves as a smooth text.
It’s better to use a uniform style of quote marks for string data in code cells: or only single, or only doble quote marks.

Hope my suggestions were helpful. Great job your work! Good luck with your future projects!

Excellent flow and organization! definitely very well done.
My feedback if I may would be:

Adding comments to your code
Labeling the figures axes and also setting a title to the figures
The last two barplots would be much easier to interpret if they were sorted

You can sort the values before plotting by using .sort_values() you can see the result of doing that below:

In your case the command should look like this by_weather_description['traffic_volume'].sort_values().plot.barh()
Keep up with the awesome work!

Ebay Car Sales - kriz,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/ebay-car-sales-kriz/554573/3,"
Hello @MrKrizzer! Thanks for sharing your project with the community:)
I’ve run through the project and I liked that you commented the code and also wrote some intermediate observations of the findings. Also good use of np.select, many people would have written a custom function to categorize mileages.
Here are my suggestions:

Leave a bit more comments. For example, in cells [23], [25], [27] you could have written Translation of fuel types, etc.
Why did you choose 1000 as the lowest price of the range? It’s still pretty  high, and I think there will be a lot of cars with prices less than 1000
It’s better to import all libraries in the first code cell to improve the readability
You have some minor typos
Write the conclusions where you summarize your findings

Guided Project: Are SAT’s fair? Analyzing NYC High Schools Dataset,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-are-sats-fair-analyzing-nyc-high-schools-dataset/554837,"
Hello @saadk687! Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! You have a nicely organized project with a short but explicit explanation of the steps you’ve taken. You also have nice plots and even explained what the SAT exam is which is important for readers outside the USA. You also left code comments in most cells.
Here are some suggestions:

You can reduce the number of sections because in some of them you have just one code block that does  only one thing like in Convert AP scores to numeric

You have some minor typos
It’s not very clear what you do in the “Condense datasets” section. It seems that you select the data for only one time period but give no motivation of why you do it
In code cells [19], [22], and [26] you can split the code into logical pieces to improve the readability
Plots are good but why not giving tick labels full names of the measures? Like what is aca_tot_11? You give the explanation after the plot but often readers won’t bother reading it and will just look at the plot

Schools having a safety score between 7 and 9 have higher SAT scores-mostly above 1600. In this case, I’d say it’s 50/50 if we look at the plot
It’s better to order borough safety scores in decreasing order because otherwise, it gives a false perception that Bronx has the highest average safety score
In conclusions, you have some HTML code
You also have a multilevel list that is hard to read
So, is SAT fair?


That’s it for me. Happy coding

Hello @adityamodi1113! Thanks again for sharing the project with the Community:)
Most of my feedback for this project is still valid:) Your code is clean and is also documented with comments (they are very important to make other people and the future you understand the code).
Here is some feedback:

Write an introduction and tell the readers what are the question you want to answer in the project
Consider writing a short summary of  the main findings in the beginning of the project

Import all the libraries in the first code cell. It helps the readability
In each section, write down what you are going to do here and why
It’s better not to write code comments in a separate code cell but in the same cell where you code is
You have some typos. Consider using Grammarly tot correct them.
Make titles cleaner. They explain well the section but Exploring brand column based on no. of sales, mean_price & mean_mileage can be change to something like Exploring brand column based on the number of sales, mean price, and mean mileage

In cell [56] there is no plot!
Some code cells still lack code comments and sometimes it’s difficult to understand what it does. Like in cell [54].
In cell [69] you have the SettingWithCopyWarning warning. Be careful because it means that your code may behave in an  unexpected way. You may read more about this warning here.

Hope these suggestions are useful. Happy coding

Hello @adityamodi1113! Thanks for sharing your project:)
Here is  my feedback:

Well done on commenting your results
It’s good that you split your project into sections, although I’d give them more attractive titles to make the reader continue the reading.
You may want to provide additional information about some countries you mention (like Pitcairn islands).
You should better motivate your choices like why you excluded “World” when searching for the most populous country. It’s logically clear but why not mention it?
I’m not sure what Cr in 136.74 Cr means. Why didn’t you write just the number?
Limit the length of lists, it will improve the readability

British Indian Ocean Territory has highest water-land area ratio. Well yes, but why the ratio is so high? You can check it up in the web and explain this high value to the readers!

Among top 5 country with highest population area ration there is only one country which has higher death rate than birth rate i.e, Monaco. Where did you show this data? I found this sentence in the section Which countries have the highest population/area ratio, and how does it compare to list we found in the previous screen?.
You can write the conclusions to summarize you finding and the most interesting results.

Happy coding:)

Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates - Comparing Presidential Terms,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/storytelling-data-visualization-on-exchange-rates-comparing-presidential-terms/554602,"
Hi @zalopez,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! Your code looks clean, the code comments are very informative.  Also, I liked your approach of trying 2 different methods for creating the visualizations.
Here are some suggestions:

You should put the project title in the very beginning of your project, not after the 1st code cell. Also, the link to the original dataset is missing.
The code cell [1] the output is a bit hard to read. You might consider adding separators between different kinds of outputs. Probably, it would be even better to show exchange_rates.head() and exchange_rates.tail() in different code cells and without using the print statement.
The code cell [4] and whenever in the future: the commented-out pieces of code should be removed from the project.
You might add more information in markdown throughout the project: background info, what we’re going to do and why, intermediate observations, etc.
Consider splitting very long lines of code into 2 or more lines.
It’s better to focus in the conclusion on the most important insights of the project, not on the ways of obtaining them. For example, what are the most interesting observations we see on the graph we created?

Hope my suggestions were useful. Happy learning!

Thanks for sharing your project on  Exploring Hacker News posts. The project is nicely organized and well presented. The introduction, aim/goal/objectives, the information background of the dataset, the comments,explanations given in the markdown cell are very informing   and  well detailed.
I love your conclusion , the summary is just  wonderful, keep it up mate.
I have got two  humble suggestions;

I think the outputs in cell[3]  could have been more presentable if they were accompanied with some explanations or just adding string to them like “the length of Ask post is 1744” and so on. Having them independent  will somehow be a challenge to some of the readers who may find the code lines complex to understand.
The outputs in cell[5],[6],[7], would be more readable if were displayed vertically, and to achieve that you can always avoid the print() function.

Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and well worked, congratulations mate!

Hi @ashwin86rajan,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! And of course, I’m very glad to know that my project was helpful! 
Your project is well-structured, with a clean code, correct conclusions, and all the code cells in order. I would suggest you just a couple of things:

It’s better to add more markdown explanations throughout the project, to explain to the reader your observations and next steps.
The code comments should be as laconic as possible, explaining only technical (and only the most necessary) details of a subsequent piece of code. Also, avoid inserting an empty line after a code comment and the subsequent piece of code to which this comment is related.
A good practice is to combine subsequent code cells that have no outputs or markdown explanations between them into one code cell.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Good  luck with your future projects!

Guided Project_ Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-visualizing-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/542702,"
Hi @Elena_Kosourova
I agree with you that this was less challenging than usual.
I think you already know how you could have shortened the number of codes by combining all the cosmetic changes and everything in one code cell.
I have found in one of the community discussions that the below code
key,spine in ax.spines.items():
        spine.set_visible(False)

This can be used with one iterating variable
key in ax.spines.values():

I think this way the code is easier to understand than with 2 variables. Both works fine though.
Also in the below code
ax.tick_params(bottom=""off"", top=""off"", left=""off"", right=""off"", labelbottom='off')

I had to use False instead of off. I think it was because of the version changes. Maybe next time if you are working on a latest/old version and if it
didn’t work try boolean values instead of ON/OFF.
I feel that our conclusions can vary depending on how we interpret certain things based on our perspectives, philosophies and life lessons. So I think your conclusions are quite good. They are strictly based on the data, that is what I felt.
Anyway good to see yet another great project from you. Looking forward for more.

Guided Project_ Winning Jeopardy,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-winning-jeopardy/553700/2,"
Hi @Elena_Kosourova,
I just finished the guided section of this project myself and am looking at completed ones before continuing with my own investigation.  Thank you very much for sharing your hard work and enabling me to learn from a top-notch contributor!
Presentation
I really like how clearly your project reads.  Your Normalizing Columns section struck me in particular as exceptionally clean and orderly.   I appreciate the formatting/structuring/writing tips you’ve given me already and I continue to aspire to your level!
Coding Tip
You mentioned you are interested in alternate coding suggestions.  I figured out a single line of code to remove the white space from the column headers I wanted to therefore share with you.  It takes advantage of the fact you can pass a function/method to the df.rename() mapper parameter.
jeopardy.rename(axis = 1, mapper=str.strip, inplace=True)
Observation on a Statistic
I also noticed when looking at your Answers in Questions section that I come to the same conclusion but with a different value for the statistic.
I believe the difference is because my count_matches function returns match_count (# matching words) while yours returns match_count/len(split_answer) (% matching words).
Calculating the mean of the % of matching words I believe results in you finding the mean percentage of words in the answer that appear in the question.  In other words, that on average 6% of the words in the answer appear in the question, which is not the same as 6% of the data having answers that appear in the question.
By returning the match_count instead I was able to create a frequency table to show that 87% of the rows match 0 words from the answer in the question, meaning that actually 13% of answers contain at least one word repeated from the question.
I hope you don’t mind me probing whether this calculation and phrasing completely match.  It’s not that important in the sense that the conclusion is the same! But I am now pondering which statistic suits the specific goal the best.  In order to disprove the hypothesis is it more effective to show that on average only 6% of words in the answer match a word in the question, or that 11% match just 1 word between the answer and question and only 2% match two or more?  I’m not really sure 
I will do my best to finish reviewing your project and sharing mine soon! 
cheers,
kwu

Thanks for sharing such an amazing project!, As I normally say, your projects are always used as  reference by most of the students( me included) for further clarification or better understanding of some parts  , especially when get stuck  and the move(to share your project) therefore is always of great importance in this community.
Have spent some  hours going trough  your work and honestly I had fun. your findings presented as summary of results motivated me to read line line by line and I gained a lot .Haven’t done this project yet, but the display/explanations ( like the relation) you gave on the traffic at night and that of the daytime change my perception( on a positive way) when it comes to traffic and thumbs up for that my dear.
The workings in cell[4] is just excellent  ,I have been  amazed with the  format, and going forward I will  incorporate the same. Talking of high traffic in 2017,  yes indeed it was due to serious contraction that was deployed(  this was after  doing some mini research ) and by the way, why did you miss to incorporate those images of contraction considering you love affirming your workings with images?
Have only two observation/suggestion to highlight;

Recheck on the explanations given under  nighttime(  under mark down cell 4) the fourth line, I think you  intended to type 25% of the nighttime and not daytime.
The function presented in cell 4, I can see you have passed a keyword  argument when calling the function which looks pretty good, but considering you have given  many parameters  going for positional argument will limits the repetition and will of course  save you some time and space.

Otherwise to me, all is well worked and congratulations mate for the cool presentation.

Have got few humble suggestions to make;

You haven’t  included comments in your workings, remember with the comments the reader will somehow have the flow of  code lines which may appear complex.
check on the style as well, most of your subtopic have asterisk(*), and I think the intension was not to include them, to fix this consider limiting the  space ,like don’t space at all   when using the double asterisk.
The output in cell 16, is too lengthy  , you ought to have considered limiting the display, to save some space.

Thanks for sharing your project on eBay Car Sales.  Honestly, have learned a lot by  going through your project. The introduction is well worked on, information background of the dataset(eBay cars)  is well detailed and well explored, the explanations given in the markdown cell , the comments are excellent. The reminders you have at the end of every section/part ( like part a,b, c ) is a indeed a good idea and they have motivated me  to keep on  reading through.
I can see you  have done an extra job by changing the non- english entries to english, and through that I have grasp the meaning of ‘andere’  which translate to others( in english) , thanks for this. You have done a good job indeed mate,keep it up!
Have got few humble suggestions to make;

I think you ought to have included conclusion( the findings in summarized format) at the end of your project.
The function in cell[22] is excellent, but you could have included the attribute astype() as well in the body of the function, to avoid too much repetition and  this could have save you space and time.
And also when working with shape, like in cell[36]  displaying the number of columns was not that relevance and therefore  specifying only the rows that is shape[0], is the best approach.

Otherwise to me everything looks great and well worked on, looking forward for more projects of  yours. Sorry for the late reply though…

You  haven’t dig deeper to the information background of the datasets you are working on , though I can see you provided the link , having few details presented in the introduction  is the best approach.
You haven’t labeled most of your plots/graph , making it difficult to relate which information is for x-axis or   the one for y-axis,  and giving the title of the plot/graph as well,  you ought to have included them.
While giving explanations on correlation, you ought to have stated what value gives positive or negative correlation, and  even for both the week and strong correlation.

Hi Damodar.cp!
Thanks for sharing your project! I took a look through, and assuming you are looking for some feedback, I have a few comments for you.

It looks like you submitted your notebook just as you finished with the project. Since we often travel back and forth between cells when we are writing up a project, it is a good idea to restart the kernel and run the entire notebook from scratch before you post it.
Inserting markup cells between your code cells in the project helps others understand what each code block is performing. It makes it a bit easier to scan your project, instead of just seeing code which requires closer inspection to understand.
In your In[15] block, it looks like you might have copied and pasted your print argument without changing the text, which makes the output harder to read.

Overall, nice job - it looks like you got the right results for the project, and are ready to move on! If I could offer one tip moving forward, it would be to design your notebooks with someone else in mind so that it is a bit easier to scan your next project.

Thanks for sharing your project  on Exploring Hacker. Have gone through it and  it looks very cool.  The aim/objective is well defined , the explanations given in the markdown cell, the conclusion are so informing. Have got few observation/suggestions to make;

Always  consider re-running your project to have  the sequential ordering of the code cells
You have hardly  used the comments, remember it’s through the comments that complex code lines can be eased up.
Check again on the styles of the  sub tittles, some are in bold , some have this (*) like in the title( this may be as a result of missing to do the spacing).

Otherwise to me everything looks nice, congratulations mate for the cool presentation.
Happy learning!

Winning Jeopardy (m210),4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/winning-jeopardy-m210/554418,"
Little notice
for cell 14  - first case Vector method

Define function for creating deep_question and deep_answer
def deep_clean_question(row):
sentence_in = row.clean_question.split()
for word in sentence_in[:]:
if word in parasite_normal_words:
sentence_in.remove(word)
if len(sentence_in) == 0:
return np.nan
else:
sentence_out = ’ ’
sentence_out = sentence_out.join(sentence_in)
return sentence_out
def deep_clean_answer(row):
sentence_in = row.clean_answer.split()
for word in sentence_in[:]:
if word in parasite_normal_words:
sentence_in.remove(word)
if len(sentence_in) == 0:
return np.nan
else:
sentence_out = ’ ’
sentence_out = sentence_out.join(sentence_in)
return sentence_out
Add new columns
jeopardy[“deep_question”] = jeopardy.apply(deep_clean_question, axis = 1)
jeopardy[“deep_answer”] = jeopardy.apply(deep_clean_answer, axis = 1)

I decided to make an experiment and tried realizing this functionality with for i, row in jeopardy.iterrows() - the second case - standard loop iteration

for i, row in jeopardy.iterrows():
question = row.clean_question.split()
for word in question[:]:
if word not in parasite_normal_words and word not in question_words:
question_words.append(word)
if word in parasite_normal_words:
question.remove(word)
if len(question) == 0:
jeopardy.at[i,“clean_question”] = np.nan
else:
sentence = ’ ’
sentence = sentence.join(question)
jeopardy.at[i,“clean_question”] = sentence
answer = row.clean_answer.split()
for word in answer[:]:
if word not in answer_words and word not in parasite_normal_words :
answer_words.append(word)
if word in parasite_normal_words:
answer.remove(word)
if len(answer) == 0:
jeopardy.at[i,“clean_answer”] = np.nan
else:
sentence = ’ ’
sentence = sentence.join(answer)
jeopardy.at[i,“clean_answer”] = sentence

Time of compilation in the second case was lower approximately ten-fifteen times than the first case. Seem that when each cell from 200 K rows extracted from string calculated as list and transformed back from list to string more optimized for specialized vector method.
How I understood  from this case - whenever possible, give preference to vector methods in the pandas and numpy.

Hi anabiagandolfi!
Whoa, I tried to figure out how the astimezone system worked, and it seems like it is implemented as a framework, rather than a built-out class. It was all really confusing, and to be honest, did not seem worth working through.
If you want, you can probably build a quick function that can take in a time, the current timezone, and the desired timezone and output the correct time. The pseudo-code would look something like this:
def change_tz(current_tz, new_tz, datetime_object):
    # pass current_tz and new_tz in as the number of hours different from UCT (ie Chicago = -5)
    time_difference = new_tz - current_tz
    updated_datetime_object = datetime_object.updatetime(time_difference)
    return updated_datetime_object

Sorry I am having a lot of trouble with markup…trying to fix it now.

Hi @zalopez,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your first project with us! You’ve done a nice work, your code is clean and efficient and the observations are correct. Also great job doing extra tasks!
Some suggestions from my side:

It’s better to remove “Project 2” before the project title. Just leave the title itself and make the font bigger.
A good idea is to add more background information about the topic in the introduction. Also, it’s important to put a link to the initial dataset.
When the project is already ready, don’t forget to re-run it to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Throughout the project, you can use more markdown comments to explain what you observed and what are the next steps.
To make the code more comprehensible, you should use code comments for some relatively complex pieces of code.
It’s better to import all the libraries at the beginning, in the first code cell.
In the code cell [7], there are a lot of empty lines, please consider removing them.
Also, you can consider gathering all the intermediate conclusions in one, at the end of the project.

Hope my suggestions were useful. Nice work and good start!
Happy learning!

Best Markets to Advertise In - Maybe,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/best-markets-to-advertise-in-maybe/554260/4,"
Hi Bruce,
Thanks for sharing another amazing project with the Community! I really liked your innovative approach to this project (instead of just following the instructions), using Pareto charts and giving some background to this dataviz type. As usual, perfect project structure, clean highly readable visualizations, cool covering picture, well-commented code, and very thorough data analysis with interesting insights!
What I would suggest to you:

Introduction. You’d better re-phrase it in such a way that the project goal goes first and then goes the information from the 1st paragraph
(the one about why we don’t want to organize a new survey).
Since you created several Pareto charts and box plots in your project, you might consider creating a function for each of these plot types, to avoid repeating the same code.
For Pareto charts, I would rotate x-tick labels, otherwise they are vertical now. Also, it’s better to change a plot title for each of them to make it more relevant to each particular plot (i.e., what exactly each plot shows).
The code cell [1]: it’s better to show only the trimmed data. Also, I’d suggest you to assign maximum number of columns to display (pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 31)) right after importing the libraries and use this maximum column value already for displaying the trimmed data in this code cell.
When creating a new dataframe (and, in general, any new variable), it’s highly recommendable to use meaningful descriptive names for them (but, of course, not too long). I mean, creating, for example, df1, df2, df3, etc., it’s easy to get very confused later in the code.
Referring long numbers in markdown, you might consider adding commas for better readability. For example, not $200000 but $200,000.
This time I noticed something weird happening with column names and pieces of code referenced in markdown: sometimes, they’re displayed wrongly, like \'JobRoleInterest\'  in the markdown after the code cell [2]. I think this is somehow related to the fact that you used html elements in you code. It’s better to find and fix such cases.
In some code cells (e.g., [2], [3], [5], [7], [9], [11]), you can consider adding inner separators (i.e., relevant print statements) for different outputs, otherwise for now they are attached to each other.

Hope my feedback was useful. Great job your project, and impressive learning pace. Good luck with your future projects!

Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL[Wole Moses]¶,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql-wole-moses/553938,"
Your project was quite good, and helped me a lot to get started, so thanks for sharing
i read it all and noticed some erros or things that could be better.
Here is a detailed comment that hope will help:

Countries with highest ratios of water to land 

You calculate a ratio which is great but then you do not use it :
%%sql
SELECT name, area_water, area_land,
CAST(SUM(area_water) AS FLOAT) / SUM(area_land) AS ratio
FROM facts
WHERE name <> ‘World’ AND name <> ‘European Union’
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY ratio DESC
LIMIT 5;

countries that have more water than Land
Here is what I suggest:
%%sql
SELECT name, area_water, area_land
FROM facts
WHERE area_water > area_land;
Thanks a lot for sharing, it really helped a lot !

Guided Project - Analyzing NYC High School Data,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-analyzing-nyc-high-school-data/554147,"
Hi Nathalia,
Welcome back and thanks for sharing another great project with us!  You’ve done a really amazing job: awsome visualizations, perfect project structure and efficient emphasizing (lists, fonts, quotation, separated code cell outputs, links), cool storytelling including introduction and conclusion, clean and perfectly commented code. And my absolute favorites are centered images and applying different colors to the output text! 
Some suggestions:

It’s better to remove numbering from the subheadings, using only the markdown hierarchy of subheadings.
You can import the re library in the 1st code cell, together with the others.
The code cell [22]: here you can use a for-loop.
The code cell [30]: no need to rotate x-tick labels here.
On the scatter plots, you can consider using the alpha parameter, to distinguish concentration of points.
I would drop some code coments like # configurating the size of the plot, # configurating the plot, since they are repeating throughout the project and also these pieces of code are self-explanatory.
About the AP test, I noticed one interesting thing. It seems that this crazy vertical line at the SAP ~1250 derives from the way of filling missing values: inserting the mean, as we did in the code cell [23]. Till now, this approach worked well, but in the case of AP test, there were just too many missing values, and they were filled with the mean value. If to ignore those not-so-missing-anymore values and re-crete the graph, the relations AP-SAT is perfectly and clearly positive, without any “noise”.
As for a potential way forward, you can take a look at SAT vs. free or reduced lunch. By the way, the insights that I received also showed that not all people have the chance to succeed in SAT. You can find useful my project on the same topic. It’s not the most updated version of it (I’m still going to upload the latest version ), but the sections about AP test and free lunch are worth reading.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Great job your project, Nathalia, and I’m not surprised that it was hard to finish: you’ve done a lot of fruitful efforts and conducted a very profound analysis. Keep up this high level and good luck with your future projects!

Guided Project - Exploring eBay Car Sales Data - Zadik,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-zadik/554269,"
Hey @zalopez,
Congratulations on the project! I really enjoyed how you polish your “Answer to question # 1”— putting the chart on markdown instead of just presenting the code output and how you described the steps you were doing. That’s important for beginner programmers to follow along with your project.
I want to give you some suggestions.

Try to divide your code into topics. You can start with “Importing libraries” and put something like “Answering question 1” and finish it with “Conclusions” — some basic stuff.
The “camelcase to snake_case”. I saw that you did this conversion by hand, right? There are other ways to do it. You can check in here.
I identify some parts like:
""autos[""odometer_km""].value_counts().sort_index()""
That you could use a chart to improve your visualization.

Those are my thoughts. I hope it helps! Again, congratulations on your project.

Guided Project 4: Heavy Traffic on I-94,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-4-heavy-traffic-on-i-94/553367,"
Hi Peter
Your project looks very nice, thanks for sharing it! I still have to do it myself since before the projects on data visualization were very different 
I liked a lot of things in your work: good overall structure, the goal and the link are clearly staated in the introduction, perfect emphasizing throughout the project, great storytelling, observations, and conclusion.
Now some suggestions:

There were several SettingWithCopyWarning throughout the project that need to be fixed.
The code cell [8]: to avoid code repeating, it’s better to create a function for these graphs.
Visualizations in general. You might consider despining and, in some cases, de-ticking them, always adding a title, increasing the title font.
The code cells [16] and [20]. It’s better to use the parameter alpha here.
The code cell [21]: probably the code comment here could be more laconic.
The code cell [25]. I would remove this long table, it’s difficult to percept, and this information was already shown on the graph.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Good luck with your future peojects, and happy learning!

The influence of demographics on SAT performance,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/the-influence-of-demographics-on-sat-performance/554157,"
Hi @radiofireworks
Thanks for sharing your project on   SAT performance. Honestly, this project is just on another level, the workings  are  so excellent, the introduction is well informing , the comments, explanations given in the markdown cell, the conclusion  are just wonderful. Keep it up mate for the good work.
I took couples of minutes going through the cleaning process and  truly I enjoyed  reading through, like  converting the columns to numerical values and creating new ones ,they have been  accompanied with well detailed explanations , and I felt like reading  through over and over again. That code line containing print(75*""-""), took me time synthesizing what could be the display , can I call i overthinking? maybe so, but  I immediately gazed it right.
The visualizations are very admirable , and have noted down some new concept that I got exposed to for the first time.
Have  noticed just one typo  under subtopic ‘read in the survey’( in the introduction)  ,first word  in the second statement, I think the intention was to type ‘they’ and not ‘the’ as presented.
Mine therefore is to congratulate you for managing to finish and also for sharing a very well organized project and am very certain that it will be of help to many of the students in this community.
Happy learning!

Welcome to this community and congratulations for having completed a project on Hacker News.
The entire project looks great cool and well presented. The code lines are well worked on and has thus rendered good output, the comments have been well displayed , most of the explanations given in the mark down cell are very informing, thumbs up mate for the good work.
Have got few suggestions to make;

it’s always advisable to include the link of the datasets  you are using, for easy access maybe by the reader.
kindly  recheck on the title,  adding a word like  ‘exploring’ Hacker news will make it more better.
You can sometime avoid print() function to  make the outputs be displayed vertically, this increases the readability, like in cell[7]
You can also consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of  the code cells.

Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and thanks for  sharing your well worked and organized project.

Fandango 2015 Movie Ratings: Legit or Bias?,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/fandango-2015-movie-ratings-legit-or-bias/554025,"
Hi Bruce,
Your project is really something incredible!  Everything is just perfect, dataviz (my favorites are box plots), covering and closing images, project structure, capturing storytelling (it’s read like a book!), project structure, clean code and excellent code commenting (all the necessary moments, and not too much). I liked your geniune interest and critical approach to the data: you did far much more than it was required in the instructions and, indeed, got some rather curious insights.

It is possible to come up with the right conclusion for this analysis but for the wrong reason.

This one is really cool, as well as the explanation thereafter,  and in general the whole chapter Some Cautions to Note. Also, your finding that in 2016 Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster were bought by Fandango was a great discovery for me and it explains a lot of things. Amazing job your digging so deep in the data!
This time I don’t have much to suggest to you, probably only these few  ideas:

The code cells [1], [2], and [9]. It’s better to separate somehow the intermediate outputs adding subheadings for each output and also empty lines in between.
File names mentioned in markdowns: you might consider enclosing them in backticks for better emphasizing.
Probably, it would be a good idea to define a function for creating KDE plots and another one - for box plots, since the codes for  each plot type are similar.

Congratulations on having done such a cool job  and good luck with your future projects!

Hi @ashwin86rajan,
Thanks for sharing your new project with the Community! And by the way, great learning pace, you’re really fast  You project is well-structured, the storytelling easy to follow, your code comments are significantly improved, all the links are available.
Some further suggestions:

Re-running your project when it’s already completed is really important. And not only for decorative purposes: sometimes it can help you to avoid confusion and wrong conclusions.
You’d better remove the word “title” before the project title, and make the title itself bigger.
I’d suggest you to remove the questions taken from the DQ instructions, but just write everything as a smooth text. Indeed, everything is already written in your project, and the initial questions are rather clear from the answers themselves. Also, it’s better to avoid writing phrases like “we are going to practice what we learned on the course”. Then the project will look more real-world rather than a learning one. This could be helpful for your portfolio in future.
A good idea is to import all the libraries at the beginning of the project, in the first code cell.
Since you created boxplots 3 times and the code is rather similar, you can consider defining a function for all of them.
It’s better to avoid empty lines in the code cells when they are not really necessary.
Please remove the last empty code cell.

Hope my ideas were useful. Good luck with your future projects and keep this fast learning pace!

Interesting idea to introduce a new class with all the necessary functions, cool and self-explanatory function naming, very clean and easily readable code, perfectly formatted outputs, curious observations about most popular apps at each market.
Some comments from my side:

You might consider making the introduction a bit more informative and  adding a dataset link. Also, I would add more intermediate markdown observations throughout the project.
It’s better to re-run the already completed project to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
A good idea is to combine subsequent code cells without outputs or markdown explanations between them into a unique code cell (e.g. [242] and [245]).
You can consider rounding some outputs ([245], [246], [247], [251]).
The commented-out pieces of code should be removed from the final version of the project.
Please consider adding code comments to less obvious pieces of code.

welcome to the community and thank you very much for sharing  your project on Exploring eBay Car Sales data . Have gone through it and the presentation is very cool. The code lines have been well worked on and has thus rendered good output.
Have got few humble suggestion to make;

Consider adding the links of  the dataset you have used for easy access by the reader.
You have hardly used comments, remember  by adding comments, the reader will be encouraged to have full engagement  of the code lines which may appear complex.
Always try to make the aim/objective/goal distinct , and one of the ways is to have them (aim/goal/objectives) as a subtopic.
You haven’t included conclusion in your workings, summarizing all the findings  after you have done all the workings(analysis)  is always very essential when working on any project.
Always consider re-running  your project after completing all the workings to have sequential ordering of the code cells.

Otherwise , congratulations mate for the entire presentation.

Hi Vadim,
Congratulations on completing another great work and thanks for sharing it with the Community! Well-organized project structure, clean code, excellent code commenting and function documentation, laconic but clear and exhaustive observations throughout the project, cool cover picture.
Some comments from my side:

The graph: you can consider despining and de-ticking it, making the title and tick labels bigger, while the figure itself smaller.
It’s better to add a short markdown explanation after the code cell [1], at least about the absence of missing values. I know that it’s clear from the output, but it’s always better to mention it explicitly.
The code cell [5]. I would add some separators or subheadings for the output, otherwise everything looks attached.
A good idea would be to avoid creating the bayes_classify_draft function. You can remove that print statement from the beginning and then just test the function on any string and print out the result.
The code cell [13] - it’s better to show the entire messages, not truncated.
I would add some markdown explanations after the code cell [14]. Practically, you can cut them from the conclusion. And in the conclusion shortly repeat them. Or even entirely, well, they are not so long 

I’d suggest you to always avoid any new information or examples in the conclusion, especially pieces of code. Only brief mentioning of the main insights of the project.

Hope my suggestions were useful.
Great job as usual! Waiting for your new projects!

Honestly, I’m not an expert in R, at least not yet  However, I have a couple of suggestions to you:

There were some warnings in the project. It’s better to fix them or at least to silence them.
Some code cells have super-long outputs, especially [9]-[11]. Please consider limiting them or even removing.
The conclusion is correct and perfect, only that I would divide it into several rows (each point - a new row).

Hello @philiplibre!
Thanks for sharing your project with the community:) I hope my feedback is not too late.
What I liked:

You have a well structured and organized project where you clearly describe the steps you take
You also left links to data dictionaries, that’s great:)
Your code is documented
You did not blindly follow the DQ instructions but also decided to check Apple apps for duplicates
Good that you verified the most popular apps that can pull up the total number of installs!
The conclusion is short and straight-to-the-point. You’ve provided concrete examples for both age categories and even combined educational and gaming criteria to create a new app

What can be improved:

Do not reference Dataquest too much. It’s good that you recognize them but make it more “my own” project:)
When you check for duplicates you do the same things for both datasets. Could you think of a way of not copy-pasting the code?
Cell [19] you say “# should ideally convert to float but returns error because of some special characters we still don’t know how to deal with”. There are ways to ignore or coerce errors, check the documentation
Why would you want to look at the app size?

Happy coding:)

Hi @kwu,
Congratulations on completing another nice project and on the overall fast pace of learning! Good project structure, all the links provided including side links, and great job digging deeper into additional information about countries!
Some suggestions from my side:

Please add a conclusion section to your project and reduce a little bit the Summary of Findings section. Ideally, it should be a short extract from the conclusion at the end.
I would exclude Antarctica from the analysis and instead investigate the next country/countries after it. Also, it’s better not to mention it in the conclusion or summary of findings.
It’s better to add some markdown explanation after every obtained table. What all those TOP10, or TOP 5, or TOP 20 mean? It would be good to find general trends in them, something what unites all those countries.
It’s important to re-run your project when already completed, also in case of SQL projects. It can happen that you created a view in an earlier code cell and are going to use it further, and not earlier.
You may find useful this guide, especially a section on white spaces (“rivers”).
Please consider limitting the output of the code cell [18].

Hi Bruce,
Thanks for sharing another amazing project with the Community!  You conducted a very thorough and profound data analysis, it’s clear that you really enjoyed working with this data! Awsome clean, and insightful visualizations, helpful additional images, cool cover picture. Good idea to use plot annotations and create a horizontal bar plot (instead of a vertical one) for the most popular tags. Interesting observations and great emphasizing throughout the project. Well done indeed!
Some suggestions:

It’s better to avoid too long (especially multi-line), too wordy, or obvious code comments (# perform all appropriate import ‘libraries’ to ensure**# executability of various commands., # read data file provided for analysis., etc.). Ideally, they should be as laconic as possible while still informative.
The code cells [10] and [12]: consider using separators for the output (adding empty lines or mini-subheadings).
The code cells [13] and [14]: here it’s probably better to create a function for the line plots, since the code is similar.
When you want to briefly explore a dataframe, consider using print(df.head()) instead of print(df), to avoid too much information.
It’s better to make the conclusion less wordy, to remove the pictures from there, as well as the definition of machine learning. It should summarize all the insights from the project without adding any new information.

Great job your project, as usual! Good luck with you future ones!

Greetings @witoldstupnicki
I have been looking at your work and something has caught my attention, check that what I say is true because I can be wrong. 
When you visualize the day and night graphs in cell 12, the axes refer on one side to the traffic volume and on the other side to the frequency. Seems odd.
If you make a histogram, which is what you do when you call plt.hist() at the bottom, what you do is to apply a table of frequencies grouped thanks to the use of the series.
When you set the condition between day and night in cell 9, I would say that it does not work properly
This is what I did:
night_bool = (traffic['date_time'].dt.hour >=19) | (traffic['date_time'].dt.hour <=7)

horas_nighttime = traffic.loc[night_bool,'date_time'].dt.hour
horas_nighttime.unique()

array([19, 20, 21, 22, 23,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7])


I hope I have not made a mistake.
I show you what I have done so that you have another point of view.
plt.figure(figsize = (15,4))

plt.subplot(1,2,1)

plt.hist(horas_daytime)
plt.xlabel('Day hours from 7 AM to 7 PM ')
plt.ylabel('Cars per hour')
plt.title('Traffic Volume: Day')

plt.subplot(1,2,2)

plt.hist(horas_nighttime)
plt.xlabel('Night hours from 7 PM to 7 AM')
plt.ylabel('Cars per hour')
plt.title('Traffic Volume: Night')

plt.show()

Guided Projects with DQ Community,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-projects-with-dq-community/553840,"
Hi @ashwin86rajan,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community!
By the way, I’d recommend you to create a new thread for each of your guided projects in future. The drawback of this approach is that the projects will be distributed in several posts, so you’ll have to search for them, when you need to revise any of them in future, for example. But the advantage is that each thread will be your own and dedicated to a specific topic, so other students, doing any of those topics, will easily find your project (due to the tags autamatically added by the system) for reviewing / suggesting / getting some inspiration from your work. And this advantage is rather important  Hence, every time when you compete a guided project, just go to the link “Share you project with the Community” (or something like this) that you’ll find on the last mission screen of that project, create a new topic with the name of your work and share your notebook directly there.
Now about this your project. You’ve done a good job, congratulations! Interesting and eye-catching title, project goal  description (including the updated one), good emphasizing throughout the project, clean and easily readable code.
What I can suggest to you:

It’s better to re-run the already ready project to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Please add a link on the original dataset in the introduction.
A good practice is to import all the libraries together (at least the “famous” ones, and it’s exactly the case of your project) in the 1st code cell.
Avoid too long, too wordy, too evident or multiline code comments. They should be as concise as possible while still technically informative. You might find useful this article about the best practices of code commenting in DS.
Avoid unnecessary empty lines in code cells (like the code cell [157]), they only increase the vertical length of a project.
When naming variables or dataframes, you’d better select a descriptive name to each, otherwise it can be difficult to manipulate all those df1, df2, etc. in future, especially if you have many of them.
It’s better to rotate x-tick labels horizontally on the last graph.
The adjacent code cells without any output or markdown explanations between them can be combined in one (like [164]+[165] or [166]+[167]).
Probably, it’s better to add more information in the conclusion, more insights obtained while doing this project.

Hope my ideas were useful. Good luck with your future projects!

Employee Exit Survey Project with comprehensive plots &amp; value_count function for dataframe,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/employee-exit-survey-project-with-comprehensive-plots-value-count-function-for-dataframe/553735,"
Hi @ahadov.rufat
What an amazing work! on Employee Exit Survey Project.  The entire project  looks awesome, and honestly have learned a lot  by going through our work. The  introduction is well  worked on, the aim/goal is so informing,the  comments looks great, most of the explanations given are wonderful and very well detailed.
I love the workings on cell[6], the dictionary created has displayed very admirable outputs, same to workings on cell[7],never imagined of creating a function when I was tackling the same task, thumbs up buddy for the good work.
Just a suggestion,  your conclusion looks somehow wide:blush: which is not such bad but I think having it shorter is the best way to go.Also having some code lines or displaying some outputs within the conclusion is not that very recommended. Remember conclusion is all about the summary of  your findings( take care as well not to break it into subtopics like conclusion 1.1,1.2… etc). Hope you will check onto that 
Happy learning!

Guided Project 2: The Hacker News,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-2-the-hacker-news/553835,"
Hi @faraz_llb
Thank you very much for sharing  your project on  Hacker News. Have gone through it and honestly I can affirm to the  improvement. The introduction is  excellent, the aim/goal   have been well displayed, the information background  of the dataset is well worked on , the conclusion is very informing, thumbs up for the good work mate. I love the way you have  introduced the doctrines in most of your workings, this has made it possible for me understand some of the code lines that appeared complex.
Having said that, I think I will point out( suggest)   observation that is in cell[7], having the outputs displayed vertically  will increase readability, and to achieve this you can always avoid the print() function, just the way you have done  in the  other outputs.
Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and well  presented , congratulations buddy for the good work.
Happy learning.

Guided Project 2: Exploring Hacker News Posts 8/8,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-2-exploring-hacker-news-posts-8-8/553712,"
Hi @nazim86,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your project with us!
The code is clean and well-commented, the results are correct, good idea to use a nice displaying format in the last code cell.
Some suggestions:

When the project is already ready, you’d better re-run the whole project to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1. It’s really important not only for aesthetical purposes but for ensuring the correctness of final results and insights: indeed, some of the code cells in your project were not run.
It’s better to remove any commented-out pieces of code from the final version of your projects.
Avoid unnecessary empty lines in the code cells: they consume the vertical space, which can become an issue in long projects.
Please consider adding more intermediate markdown observations throughout the project and give more information in the introduction: project goal, problem background, general information on the website, dataset link.
A good practice is to be consistent with emphasizing in markdown: use bold or italic (avoiding using them together, i.e. bold+italic) only rarely, to make evident something important. Also, use bullet or numbered listing only when you have 2+ items to be listed.

Hope my suggestions were helpful. Good luck with your future projects!

Hello @alekseikondratenko7,
You spiced up the project with those plots! The text was well explained, and you commented on all the code. Congratulations. The only thing I would change is the color palette. You used some colors that I think you should reconsider, like that pizza graphic with that yellow and that graphic for “Star Wars episode rankings by gender” that’s also too yellow for me.
Your project was so good that the only improvement I can suggest it’s about the colors, hahaha.

Project 2 Hacker News Posts,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-2-hacker-news-posts/553562,"
Hi @vinaynathan99,
Thanks for sharing your work with the Community! Your project is nice, with clean code, easy-to-follow storytelling, cool introductional and conclusional parts. Well done!
Here are a couple of suggestions from me:

It’s better to use quotation style only for real quotations. For markdown observations, a common markdown style is preferred.
You mentioned the link on Hacker News website twice in the introduction, better to avoid repetition and leave only one of them.
You might consider adding subheadings to different sections of your project. This will help to make the whole project structure more clear.
Even though your code is already rather comprehensible, it’s better to add code comments to some less obvious parts.

Hope my ideas were usefull. Good luck with your future projects and happy learning!

Thanks for sharing your project on Exploring Ebay Cars Sales . The entire project looks awesome, the introduction is well worked on, the explanations given are very informing, the code lines looks great and has therefore rendered  good output, keep it buddy for the good work. I love the descriptions given on cell[15], they are well detailed and well staged.  Have got few humble suggestions to make;

Always consider including the link  of the dataset you are using for easy access by the reader.
in cell[10], I think having df.columns is the best way because I gaze  the idea was just to show the changes made in the columns.
In cell[18] and [22]  you can consider have the code lines in a single line , to avoid too much repetition and I think it will also save you space and time.
The whole work looks very nice  and therefore it was good to summarise  all the workings(findings) in the conclusion,.

Mobile App for Lottery Addiction (m382),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/mobile-app-for-lottery-addiction-m382/553667,"
Hi Vadim,
Congratulations on having completed another great project! I liked your clean and easily comprehensible code, cool function documentation, the idea to check the input of some functions for being valid, and the whole approach to make this project laconic but intense. Also, cool cover picture! 
What I would suggest to you:

To add an input also to the first function. Remember that the user would wish to input some information anyway (he isn’t familiar with the probability theory and thinks that the exact numbers influence the overall probability to win ).
To make all the returns from your functions user-friendly. Once again, the players probably don’t know what permutations mean, so they want to see just a text if they win or not with their exact numbers or their number of tickets.
To be careful with typos, especially in function documentation.
To avoid some obvious code comments (# Display first five rows, # Display info about dataset, # Convert list to set, etc.).

Great job as usual! Keep this learning pace and quality level!

Hello @jeprim!
Congratulations on sharing your first project, it is an important step in your learning path!
What I liked:

Code comments. It is very important to document your code because other people will understand it better, but it’s also important for future you if you ever want to review the code again with new knowledge and experience:) Even though, sometimes it’s a bit redundant it’s a good practice to start commenting, with time and experience you will improve this skill. Here a good guide to commenting in Python.
A lot of  links to documentation of the datasets
Clear explanation of your steps

What can be improved:

Title the project
Provide a more detailed introduction. It’s not very clear what’s is the main goal of the project
Document the functions. You can use docstrings. It will be especially useful for the function explore_data that has multiple arguments
Reduce the number of shown categories/apps, etc. Maybe show the TOP 10, it will improve the readability
Conclusion is okay but maybe you want to expand it a bit, motivate better the choice. You can also repeat that the company should develop the Android version of the game and if it brings profits, develop the iOS version

Happy coding

Oh, I’m really glad and proud to hear that my suggestions inspired you to write such a great work!  And don’t be modest, you project is amazing and interesting, and after reading it, just the opposite, I won’t sleep all the night, being fascinated!   I especially like your plots, they are so clean, informative, and insightful, without any distraction for the reader, only the most necessary information shown. The narrative and all the observations are very interesting, smooth, and easy to follow. It’s also cool that you distinguished data wrangling as the second sphere to investigate and write some materials on. When I was doing the same project, I didn’t notice this information  And in general, perfect structure, clean code and code commenting!

Hi @yarrowmadrona
Thank you very much for sharing your project on Exploring eBay Car Sales. I have gone through it and it looks pretty good. The  code lines are so excellent and thus rendered good output. Most of the explanations given  are so informing, I love  the way you included 	unrepaired_damage column, it  makes  your conclusion  so informing.

yarrowmadrona
There were a number of cases where the vehicle type was “NaN” but it was listed in the name

If the   vehicle type column has some name indicated ‘NaN’ as the only string then I think  you can use dropna() that will drop all the rows with missing data  labelled as NaN.
Having said that  , have got two humble suggestions to make;

Your project lacks a title which is very essential when working any project, please consider adding it .
You have also hardly use the comments, remember it’s through the comment that the reader will have full understanding of code lines which may appear complex. hope you will fix that in your upcoming projects.

I liked that you explained well every step you’ve done and you also find a more elegant way to convert the Job Dissatisfaction to True or False in the TEFE. Also good job on proposing some improvements to the project:)
What can be improved:

Reduce the number of sections (for example, the first two sections (Data Set - At A Glance and DETE Survey - At a Glance can be merged)
Do not reference the DQ instrtuctuion. These are just guidelines and the project is yours. Explain why you drop column (why they are irrelevant), motivate your code with your own thoughts!
Do not include too many technical details in Markdown (like in the section DETE Survey - At a Glance)
You have some typos and also unfinished sentences (like A quick check at Established column data indicates institute_serivce durations of 7,8,9 and 10 years were included and they were.)
Be aware of the SettingWithCopyWarning. It may cause problems. You can read more about it here

Improve you plots: label the axes, title them, remove top and right spines, remove the legend. The title you’ve given to the plot is more a subtitle and it good but do not forget about a shorter title:)

As I always admit, having your project shared in this community means  a lot to most of the student( me included)  since  the workings/steps you do provide  always have got additional information which are very crucial  and always render admirable  outputs if incorporated.
For the introduction, it’s well worked , the goal/objectives are well displayed, the comments together with the doctrines have reduces the complexity of some of the functions, the explanations given are just excellent. Those findings given  in the conclusion are so informing. I love the test  performed in cell [2], the entire code lines are very open and easy to follow.  keep it mate ,have really enjoyed reading through your project and have gained a lot as well.
I think incorporating emojis   in the workings is an excellent idea , and honestly , have been nice with those emojis, their  looks have  that positive impression on the  explanations given, and I think non of the reviewers will get  discouraged

Hi Vadim,
I’m becoming a fan of you projects!  Great everything: very profound data analysis demonstarting curiosity to the data and the story behind it, amazing dataviz and even the cover picture, great idea to rotate heatmaps horizontaly to display the column names in the best way, interesting separate look at countries of living and citizenship, cool and uncommon conclusion about all 4 countries. I also liked the part of your analisis about gender and age ratios, and also where you found and explained the inadequacy of strange and too elevated course cost values. I noticed that you did this project in quite different way and didn’t create those ugly squeezed box plots (believe me, your lost nothing! ). Very cool!
A few suggestions:

It’s better to always add an empty line before a code comment, to separate this block from the code above. Look, for example, the code cell [15].
You might consider to make some of intermediate markdown observations more extended and wordy, to explain more in detail the insights at each step.
Visualizations: always add a title. Also, it’s better to increase the font size of axis labels and tick annotations. And I would decrease the height of the plots in the code cells [10] and [11].

Great job, Vadim, waiting for your new projects! Happy learning!

Hello @Amaryllis! I hope that my feedback can still be valuable to you.
Well done on thinking and implementing another approach to resolve the same problem, it’s a great skill that is very useful in data science (and in life, general). You code is cleaner that the one proposed by DQ so well done!
Overall your project is nice and your comments on the results look professional but here are some things to improve:

Write a more descriptive introductin: like what’s the goal of the project?
You can provide more information about the database you worked with: like what infromation it contains, for instance.
I noticed that in the section ** Selecting New Albums for Purchase** you copied the text from the DQ team. Could you try to rewrite it in your own words?
Comment on your code! Some clauses are quite complicated and it will be difficult for your and the others to undestand the exact approach of extracting useful information from the data.
Write conclusions: wrap up all your results and answer the initial questions? Did you find something interesting? What are your recommendations to Chinook?

Hi @pavelbrn
Welcome to the community and thanks for sharing your project on Exploring Hacker News Posts. The codes  have been well worked on and has thus rendered good output. The explanations  given are so informing, the conclusion as well has been well presented, I love  how you have customize the color of the subtopics they are admirable, great job indeed mate! keep it up.

 pavelbrn
Should I enter each code snippet into a new cell of enter all of my code into a single cell under a subheadline?

I think this will depends on the type of project  you are working and you will also have some factors to  consider. For example  you will notice that some outputs require immediate explanations such that when mix with other outputs, the whole staff will some  how be less readable  and the code lines will as well appear complex. So I think having each code snipped into a new cell or the whole code lines into single cell isn’t  a big deal,but you can always go for having the code lines  into new cells .

 pavelbrn
Any other feedback would be appreciated.


It’s always advisable to add the link of the dataset you are working on , for easy access by the reader/reviewer.
You haven’t included comments in your entire working, remember it’s through the comments that the reader will have understanding of some of your code lines that may appear complex. Hope you’ll checked onto that in your upcoming projects.
Most of  the outputs like in cell[116], has been displayed  horizontally, which to me is somehow less readable, you can  have them displayed vertically  by avoiding the print() function.
Also consider re-running your project to have the sequential ordering of the cells.

Otherwise to me, everything looks great and congratulations mate! for the good presentation.
Happy learning!

Pretty Presentation? Exploring Heavy Traffic Indicators Using Data Visualizations,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/pretty-presentation-exploring-heavy-traffic-indicators-using-data-visualizations/553148,"
First of all great job on finishing this project, It was a hard one !! The presentation is great. I like how you used bool_night = ~bool_day which is really smart and never occurred to me!
As of the presentation you might want to check the following points:

The conclusion Should be written at the end of the notebook and not after the introduction.
Using print(dataset.head()) generates the table in an unorganized way, it is better to use dataset.head() directly as it generates a good looking table. You will need to write the df.head(), df.tail() and df.info() each on a separate cell so they can all get printed.
Some figures are missing titles or x/y labels.
Try using a multilevel headers more. For example instead of this

Daytime Traffic Volume - Business Days vs. Weekends
Visualize Data - Plot Grid of Hourly Traffic Volume Comparison


You can use this
Daytime Traffic Volume - Business Days vs. Weekends
Visualize Data - Plot Grid of Hourly Traffic Volume Comparison


Good luck with the rest of your journey

Hi @kwu
Welcome to the community and thank you for sharing  on Analyzing Ebay Car Sales . Have gone through it and it has been well worked on.  The codes are well presented and  has thus rendered nice outputs, the explanations given are well detailed, the comments are well tackled … keep it up mate. Have got few humble suggestions;

It’s always recommended to include the aim of the project, like what are the questions you are trying to answer or to clarify , and  you try as much as possible to have it short( that is the aim/goal/objective)  . same to title, you can instead have it as Analyzing Ebay used cars.
I don’t think if most of the information given in the introduction are that necessary, Instead you ought to have included the information background of the data,the aim/objectives,  and the links of the data set you have used, hope you will check into that.
Also consider re-running your project for sequential ordering of the code cells.

Otherwise congratulations! for having completed  the project on Ebay Car Sales.

Thanks for sharing another project on Analyzing CIA Factbook .Honestly I love the pace at which you are working on your projects , this displays how commitment you are on your learning path, keep it up mate. The whole project is well presented, the aim is well distinguished, the analysis walkthrough is so informative , a lot of facts have been exposed. you have done great job in the conclusion, those stylings are excellent . Have got few suggestions ;

I think you could have created the subtopic for the statistic elements like minimum population, don’t think if  listing them is enough.
Also, you ought to have given rough explanations on some of  the outputs for example, why China has got the highest population or why Bangladesh considered to be the most densely populated country and so on…

Otherwise congratulations for submitting a well defined and organized project, and by the way, this project contained a lot of areas to be explored like birth rate, death rate and so on,  you will surely  interact with very interesting facts…

Hi Vadim,
Wow, your project is just amazing!   Great choice of visualization techniques and fantastic resulting graphs  (my favorite are your strip plots, where the issue with Fandango is scaringly obvious), very interesting and profound approach to statistical analysis, cool observations, project structure, emphasizing, and code commenting. Just super!
This time it’s really difficult for me to suggest to you something useful 

Probably, it’s better to make plot titles and legend annotations bigger.
Don’t forget to add an empty line before a code comment and a previous code.
Be careful of typos.

Great job, Vadim, congratulations!

Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94 (Guided Project),1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/finding-heavy-traffic-indicators-on-i-94-guided-project/552906,"
Hi @adetolaadeya,
Very good project! Well-structured, with all the necessary links, with the aim clearly stated, interesting observations throughout the narrative, and informative and clear conclusion. Great job!
A couple of suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to combine adjacent code cells that don’t have any output or markdown observations between them, like the code cells [18]-[20], even if the resulting code cell will become long.
Avoid some obvious code comments like #Read in the data, #display first five rows, etc. Also, it’s better to avoid inserting an empty line after a code comment and the piece of code to which it’s related. You might find useful this article.
A good practice is to remove unnecessary spines from the graphs and, probably, increase the font of axis labels. Also,  some of your graphs lack titles, I’d suggest you to always add a title to all graphs.

Hope my ideas were interesting. Thanks for sharing your nice work and good luck  with your future projects!!

Guided Project: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-finding-heavy-traffic-indicators-on-i-94/552959,"
Hi @pigeon,
Welcome to the Community and thank you for sharing the first project with us! You’ve done a good job, presented well the data and your observations. And I liked the project title, it seems interesting and captures attention. Well done!
What I would suggest you for this and future projects:

It’s better to expand a bit the introduction, adding the link to the dataset and probably giving some background to the problem. Also, you should always add the conclusion with the most important results.
Avoid too long code comments (like in code cell [28]) or some obvious or too narrative code comments like  # check data, # does day match night?. You might find useful this article.
When the project is already completed, a good practice is to re-run it, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1. It’s important not only for decorative purposes, but for the results of the project.
It’s better to combine adjacent code cells if they don’t have any output or markdown cells between them (eg. [8], [2], [4]).
You might consider despining your plots. Also, some graphs lack a title ([10]), it’s better to always add one.

I hope my suggestions were useful. Nice job your project!

Welcome to the the community and thank you very much for sharing your project on Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings. Have gone through it and it’s well presented.the code lines looks good ,thus rendering admirable outputs. The explanations have been well worked on, I love most of your plots, like the one in cell[62] , they  look awesome. Thumbs up buddy for the good work. Having said that , have got few humble  suggestions to make;

You haven’t at all included comments in your workings, being that you have explained most of the steps in the markdown cell, it’s also advisable to do the same in the code cell, remember comments helps to break down those code line that seems to be complex.
I can see you have included your aim in the middle of your projects which is still good, but the  better approach is to have it in the introduction.
Have encountered SettingWithCopyWarning which is so often when working with dataframe, you can go through this -SettingWithCopyWarning: How to Fix This Warning in pandas

Also check on the conclusion, Am still figuring out whether the last workings were your findings, but the better approach is to contained them is a subtopic named ‘conclusion’
Consider re-running your project to have sequential ordering of the cells.

Otherwise to me., everything look nice and well presented, congratulations!  for the good work.

A Unique Star Wars Survey Project 2,12,https://community.dataquest.io/t/a-unique-star-wars-survey-project-2/552657/10,"
Hi Bruce,
Wow, you are making really very fast progress in learning from one project to another, congratulations indeed!  I’m afraid soon I will not be able to suggest you anything new, because everything will become just perfect!  It’s clearly visible that you are a fan of Star Wars, since you were really enjoying conducting this analysis. Perfect overall project structure, interesting and capturing storytelling, all the necessary subheadings, observations, links, markdown emphasizing: fonts, numbered lists, but what’s more - even colors! It was a good idea to divide long code lines into several lines for better readability. Awsome and very clean visualizations, with a good choice of colors. Also, I liked the analysis by age category, and introducing Kruskal-Wallis Non-Parametric Test was something completely fresh and incredible! Great job!
Some comments from my side, hopefully still useful 

It’s better to keep code comments as laconic as possible. All the explanations and observations go to markdown. Also, you might consider removing the empty line between a code comment and the code itself. Everything will be still perfectly readable, only that it helps to save the vertical space of the project.
If the neighbor code cells don’t have any output or markdow explanations between them, it’s better to combine them into one code cell, even if they contain different informational blocks (like [3] and [4] or [21] and [22]).
I’d suggest you to remove those backslashes from question numbers,  they are really scaring .
For some bar plots, you can consider rotation of x-tick labels ([5], [7], [9]), otherwise now they are vertical. The code cell [9]: better to remove spines also here.
For the bar plots with a lot of bars ([22]), a good idea is to create a horizontal plot instead of vertical.
The code cell [6]: here you might consider using a function to optimize the code.
In the code cells with a lot of print() statements (for example, [2]), it’s better to insert an empty line between different outputs (print('\n')).

I hope my ideas were interesting. Amazing job your project, keep up this level!

Hi Radu,
Your project is absolutely cool, and I’m glad that my project gave you an inspiration to create such a great work!  I liked the overall project structure including Results Summary, smooth and exhaustive introduction and conclusion, interesting storytelling in general, all the necessary links and markdown emphasizing. Good idea to gather all the functions at the beginning of the project for an easier reference. Awsome visualizations, good idea to make box plots horizontal. And my favorite stem plots and missingno!  As for the countries where the respondents live I even didn’t know some names, for example Guam!  Now I wonder if here on DQ we have some students from there.
A couple of suggestions from my side:

It’s better to increase the titles and axis labels of the plots for readability purposes.
A good practice is to combine the subsequent code cells that have no outputs or no markdown cells between them, like [2]-[4], [5]-[6], [13]-[14], even if they represent different ideas.
When referring to string data in code cells, it’s better to use a uniform style for quote marks throughout the project: or only single, or only double quote marks.

I hope my ideas were useful. Congratulations on having done a great job, keep up this high level!

Popular Data Science Questions (m469),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/popular-data-science-questions-m469/552648,"
Hi Vadim,
Thanks for sharing another nice project with the Community! Great project structure, neat visualizations, well-commented and organized code (including also function commenting in a correct and exhaustive way), all the necessary links are available. Good approach to import all the necessary libraries at the beginning, and to re-run the completed project. And of course, that’s great that you extracted fresh data for 2020, instead of using the proposed dataset for 2019. Great job!
Now some suggestions:

You’d better re-write the sentence “Pretend that I working in the company” in the introduction in some other way.
When mentioning column names and pieces of code in markdown, it’s recommended to use backticks, to make them in evidence.
Consider using the same color for all bars in a bar plot, if applying different colors doesn’t highlight anything in partcular (the code cells [8] and [12]).
The code cells [9], [11], and [13]: better to add more white spaces between different code pieces (namely, before each code comment).
The code cell [11]: there is a warning to fix, or at least to silence.
Visualizations in general. Don’t forget to add a title to each and consider increasing font size for the axis labels.
The code cell [15]: consider using also here a scatter plot, like you did in [10] .Which was a great idea there, by the way!
The code cell [13]: the output is a bit hard to digest, probably no need to display it.
The last section of your project Definition growth question Machine-Learning by year and quarter from start for Q12021 and general stats for tags. It’s better to rename it somehow shorter. Also, it could be a good idea to add some more intermediate markdown explanations in this section, since it’s rather saturated with information and graphs. It will be easier for a reader to follow the whole workflow then.
The code cell [16]. Just a curiousity: why do we have those peaks there? I cannot figure it out myself.

Hope my comments were useful. Good luck with your future projects!

You have worked on correlation perfectly,  though I am still figuring out why  you decided to exclude the week  correlations( between -0.25 to 0.25) in your analysis, maybe you can brief me . Reading a link into pandas is one of the new concepts have gained while going through your  project(  that is, the workings in cell[26]).A lot of facts have been exposed in your analysis and I think   the visualizations  aided to this, they are so admirable. keep it  up buddy , the entire presentation is just perfect.

P.S. autos.brand and autos[‘brand’] give the same output. However the first one is much faster to write. However, I’ve seen that this method of calling a column not the most recommended. Is it true or it doesn’t matter?

Actually both will display same output just as you have admitted,  so  I don’t  think which one to use  becomes a big deal, you can just go for the one you are comfortable with.
Having said that, have got few humble suggestions to make,

your project  lacks a title  which is very key when working on any project, please consider fixing it.
It’s advisable to provide the link of the dataset you are using for easy accessory.
Be very careful on typos, like in the introduction, second paragraph, I think the intention was to type ‘from Dataquest…’ and not ‘fro Dataquest…’
Kindly check cell[3], and cell[33] were the workings, codes or  comments?, like in  cell[3] those workings seems to be codes but you presented them as comments.

Hello @witoldstupnicki!
Thanks for sharing your project:)
The project is very easy to follow: you wrote only what’s strictly necessary.
Just a few suggestions:

You can add two bigger headings: Data Cleaning and Data Analysis to logically split the project
Beware of removing the cars that cost less than 50 dollars. Some of them may be just donations or the initial price for bids
When you sort the date_crawled  column by index it’s not very evident that “the most popular day for the ad crawl was 2016-04-03, with 3.86% share”. You can sort the column by the share number. The same goes for the last_seen column.
At the beginning of the analysis, you may specify what are the questions you want to answer.
You can sort the prices by brand in the descending order
Good use of the corr function! But 0.56 is a pretty big number, are you sure that there is no correlation between these values?
There is also no correlation between those two values. = which values? You have to write that they are mileage and price otherwise it’s not very clear especially if the reader jumps straight into conclusions.

Hi @clarkebacharach,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community!  And that’s great that you know the car market in general,  because when I was doing the same project, everything was new to me! 
Here are some of my thoughts for your consideration:

I’d suggest you to modify the introduction and the project title. You could call it something like Analyzing data from German cars on eBay, and in the introduction, instead, you might consider giving some problem background, dataset link and the project goals.
Please add the conclusion summarizing the most important insights.
Throughout the project, I saw some commented-out pieces of code (eg. in the code cell [541]). You’d better consider or deleting, or uncommenting them.
In the code comments, it’s better to be more laconic (for example, in the code cell [555] the comments are redundantly wordy). Also, in the code cells [538], [541], [554] and some others, the code comments would look better as markdown observations, since they actually don’t comment directly any piece of code.
You can consider combining subsequent code cells in one, if they don’t have any output or markdown observations afterwards. For example, [533]-[535], and in other similar cases.
The markdown after the code cell [542]: it’s better using a normal font style here rather than bold+italic.
The code cell [549]: you can create a dataframe directly from  a dictionary.
The code cells [529], [565], [566], [569], and in some others: please remove ; to obtain an output.
Since autos is too long, you might consider using autos.head() instead, in all those occasions.
The code cell [561]: the warning should be fixed.
It’s better to delete the redundant subheading Libraries for Guided Project, also because some of important libraries were already imported by then.
The code cell [563]: you might consider deleting this cell.
The code cell [564]: too long output, should be fixed somehow.
It’s better to emphasise the column names with backticks, when mentioning them in markdown for improved readability.
When the whole project is completed, it should be re-run, to have all  the code cells in order and starting from 1 (to avoid any potential confusion in the code performance).

I hope my feedback was helpful. Happy learning!

Hello @sbgraham72!
I hope my feedback is still valuable:)
You have a nicely organized project but here are the things that can be improved:

You do not have to import matplotlib multiple times, one time, in the beginning, is enough
It’s better to tell the readers what are the main questions you’d like to answer in the project
It a good idea to introduce your plots and make comments below each plot otherwise it’s difficult to follow
Many of your plots are not necessary, they seem to be there just for the sake of it
You can add titles to the plots and improve their style. There is a nice article by @Elena_Kosourova that can help you make the visualizations better
You definitely know something  about hypothesis testing, and Python has this functionality. Check the SciPy library. You can add some tests to your project:)

Thanks for sharing your really cool project with the Community! Everything looks perfect: amazing visualizations (I liked also the combination of colors that you chose for your graphs), the project itself is very organized and well-structured, with all the necessary links and emphasizing. Also, very detailed and informative background context to the problem, as well as the conclusion. Well done indeed!
Some minor suggestions from my side:

You might consider dropping some obvious code comments like # Imports, # Read in the datasets, # Show the datasets.
What were the warnings that you had before in the project? were they really not crucial? Well, I became curious about it exactly after your comment to that code line 

It’s better to use a uniform quote mark style for all the string data in the code.
In the introduction, you mentioned an article with a long name and created a link to it. I would suggest you, since the name of the article is quite long, to limit the link text to “this article” instead of its real name.
It’s better to use plt.show() to avoid an unnecessary information in the output.

Great job your project! Waiting for another one next month then

Thank you very much for sharing your project on Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys. Have gone through your work and it’s  well worked. The introduction is so informing, the objectives are very clear, the use of comments are just wonderful. You have done a great job in the conclusions, the findings are indeed recommendable.  I love the way you have used the seaborn, they have displayed very admirable plots , like that in cell[67] and even the one in  your last  code, the visualization is just perfect. keep it up mate for the good work. have got few humble suggestions;

Including ‘guided project’ as a project tittle, is not that recommended . Remember this could be one of the project you may wish to share with one of your potential employer, and with  ‘guided project’ as a title, I don’t think if it will create good impression.
Also,  you have  repeatedly  indicated the subtopic ‘conclusion’ , though it’s not that worrying to use , but I think you should instead use  other words like ‘observation’ .Most people have perception that once you include conclusion, then that’s should mark the end of your project.
Also some of the outputs like in cell[13] needed explanations, though I can see you were frank on this , but I hope all will be well as you continue working and interacting with various projects.
Lastly,always  consider re-running your project to have sequential ordering of the cells,.

Otherwise to me, everything look nice and well presented,  all the best in your upcoming projects.

Feedback on GP: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-on-gp-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/552383,"
Hi  @mathmike314
Thank you for sharing your project on  Analyzing CIA Factbook Data.  The project is so  cool and well worked on. The introduction   is well fed with information,  the objectives, the explanations given  are so informing. I love the summary you have given in the conclusion , those findings are highly recommendable.
Have got a suggestion, I think you could  have elaborated further on some of the outputs. Like for example , while checking the most densely populated country(eg Bangladesh) , giving reasons  that has triggers to this factor  would be better. Also explaining why China is the most highly populated country ,  could have added more positive impact in your project.
Otherwise to me, everything looks great and just congratulating you for the good work.
Happy learning.

Guided Project_Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-finding-the-best-markets-to-advertise-in/552382/5,"
Hi @Elena_Kosourova
Am very glad to interact with another project of yours on Finding the Best markets to Advertise In.
Have took couples of hours going through your project and honestly have  gained  a lot. On realizing that it took you almost a whole month to finish the project, I was so curios about this, and decided  to fully engage  my understanding in every step which in return paid off . I ended up noting  down some of the code lines that I interacted with for the first time and were so interesting  .The information given in the introduction, are so awesome, the exposure given  on E-learning , the aim are just excellent. I love how you have summarized the results.
Information background of the dataset has been well worked on, the links provided, general information about freeCodeCamp  is  just wonderful.
Being that haven’t tackle this project, the doctrines you included in the functions help me to understand most of the functions that appeared to be complex. The explanations you gave on   which columns to be retained are awesome.
While going  through the analysis I noticed   some interesting plots like the stem plots, well printed tables  and so on, all these  motivated me to get into details of what the output entails ,facts were never hidden.  I love the way you dealt with the outliers, the explanations given are so recommendable, the conclusion is so informative and nicely presented.Just want to thank  you mate for  sharing your project, which from the beginning has been helpful to most of the learners.
kindly check on the auto-generated link( for viewing purposes of the project) , it’s returning an error, I think reuploading the project will solve the problem. And is `missigno’ supported by Anaconda? have tried working with it locally in my machines  but  ‘module not found error’ was returned, or is there additional libraries I need to have in my machine?.
Happy learning.

Hi @myers.petera
Welcome to the community and thanks for sharing your project on Exploring eBay Car Sales Data .The project looks cool, the introduction is so informing, the explanations given are just wonderful. I love the way you have organized some of the stages , into problems, they have been well worked on and nicely presented, thumbs up for the good work. have got few suggestions;

you have hardly used the comments, kindly consider including them in your upcoming projects.
It’s also advisable to re-run the entire project to have sequential numbering of the code cell, you will notice that the last 3 code cells have not been numbered.
also since you were exploring the eBay car Sales, I think  adding  for example the most expensive car and so on, in the conclusion, will make the conclusion to be more informing.

Otherwise  to me, everything looks nice and well presented, all the best in your upcoming project.
Happy learning!

Hi @cameron_rex
Thanks for sharing anther project on Analyzing Ebay Used  Car  data. The project is well organized and nicely presented.  Explanations given are so awesome, the use of comments , the introduction  are so cool. I love the way you have do away with the outliers, the use of  1.5xIQR rule is indeed the best approach. The reviews you have given in the conclusion are indeed informing, thumbs up buddy for the good work. Having said that, have got few humble suggestions to put across;

It’s always advisable to include in the introduction, the links of the dataset you are using for easy access.
Check on cell[153],  I think the intention was to have both first five rows in the price column and a new space(’\n’) displayed , but it never happened , I think in such cases applying print() function will help out.
Lastly, check on the style , more so when giving explanations, some are type in bold, some typed the normal way and so on, mixing them up don’t think is the best approach.

Otherwise to me, everything looks good and well worked, congratulations mate for the good presentation.

Answering Business Questions using SQL (m191),3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/answering-business-questions-using-sql-m191/552377,"
Hi Vadim,
Congratulations on finishing yet another nice project and again on a very rapid learning pace! 
Some ideas from my side for your consideration:

It’s better to have a more wordy introduction, giving the background context of the problem, as well as more wordy markdown explanations describing the steps to do and the intermediate results afterwards.
You should use or only bullet, or only numbered style for the same markdown list (like the one  in the conclusion).
The picture after the code cell [2] is not displayed for some reason. Probably this short post can help to resolve it.
You might consider limiting the output of the code cell [6], otherwise it looks too long.
Another thing to consider is rounding the outputs of some code cells ([3], [4], [5], etc.), to avoid unnecessary decimal points.
As for the SQL code style and improving its readability, this guide could be of use, especially the part about white spaces (“rivers”).
Be careful of typos, especially in the subheadings.

Hope my suggestions were helpful. Good luck with your future guided projects and keep this fast learning!

What a wonderful project! on Exploring Hacker News  with the help of pandas and matplotlib. I admired like all the  steps you have worked on, your introduction is so informing, the use of comments , the explanations are well worked on an well presented. I love the way you have applied regex to check the titles that contain the Ask HN and Show HN., the extraction you did in cell[5], is also wonderful , thumbs up for the good work. The visualization process is well displayed and I like the listing you have done in the conclusion , those findings are so recommendable. Having said that, have got a suggestion to put across;

In cell[11] you could have applied the reset_index() to the dataframe (df_mean), to avoid creation of  ‘type’ as a new object but instead add it as column , same applies to cell[18]


Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and just congratulating you for the nice presentation.

Are SAT Tests Fair to ALL?,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/are-sat-tests-fair-to-all/552272,"
Hi Bruce,
Wow, I have to say that your projects are really becoming more and more impressive and professional! Congratulations on such a fast learning progress! I liked plenty of things in your project: great introduction to the problem background with a link to the dataset, smooth storytelling, good code structure and code commenting (especially cool idea to divide long code comments into several line), displaying the school names in question in blue (and in general using HTML elements in markdown). Great job!
Some suggestions from my side:

It’s better to add more subheadings throughout the project (where necessary, of course).
As for the observations (which, by the way, are very thorough and interesting), here just the opposite, I wouldn’t use subheading style but normal font emphasizing: bold or italic. Otherwise, you did well to emphasize some important points all around the project.
It’s enough to import each library used in the project only once, usually gathering all of them in the first code cell. It’s also true for %matplotlib inline.
A good practice is to use a uniform quote mark style for string data type throughout the project: or only single, or only double.

Visualizations. I’d suggest you to add plot titles, remove the unnecessary spines and ticks, increase figure size, consider using the same color for all bars of a plot (for example, in the code cell [11], but also in the others) if the variety of colors doesn’t communicate anything in particular.  In the code cells [11], [14], [20]: you might consider using a horizontal bar plot instead, to avoid vertical x-tick labels.
The code cell [26]: it’s better to fix the FutureWarning.
The code cell [28]: a good approch here would be to use a for-loop.
The code cell [29]: here you can consider rounding the output values.

I hope my ideas were helpful. Happy learning, keep this fast progress and curiosity for the data!

Hi @renatodepes
Welcome to the community , and thanks for sharing your project on Exploring Ebay car Sales Data. The projects looks great and well organized. I love your introduction, the aim, the explanations, the code lines, all are well presented.  Also you have managed to write most of the code lines into  a single line of code, which is just an awesome idea. have got few suggestions;

Output in cell[2], is too lengthy, I think in such cases you can head() method  to limit the number of output.
You have hardly used the comments, remember it’s through the comments that a reader, can fully engage and somehow understand  most of your code lines.
since you were exploring the data on  ebay used cars,  I think typing down some of the findings in the conclusion, will add more positive look onto your project.

Otherwise congratulations for the good work and wishing you the best in your upcoming projects.

Thanks for sharing your project on Exploring Ebay Car Sales  Data. Have gone through it and have gained a lot. Your introduction is just  excellent, comments have been well worked on, the explanations given , the visualization part are so informing indeed. I love the way you have organized the investigation stage, the general observation, indicating  the valid columns, columns to be deleted , columns to be investigated further is awesome idea, thumbs mate for the good work. Having said that, have got few humble suggestions to point out;

Consider adding a link of the dataset you used in the project just for easy access, for any reader who may wish so.
Take care while numbering your stages,you will notice that you  repeated stage one, by having both investigation  and cleaning stage as stage one.
Also you have repeatedly indicated cleaning stage, I think having  it as single stage  and then performing the steps needed will be better.
consider e-running the project, to have sequential ordering of the code cells.

Hi @sharmithewriter,
Welcome to the Community and congratulations for sharing your first project!  The results are correct, the code is clean and well-organized, and yes, it’s really very well-commented 
Here is my feedback:

I would suggest you anyway to add markdown explanations and project structure elements (title, introduction, dataset link, subheadings, conclusion). Because the guided projects are not only about coding (which is a very important part in any case), but also, and especially, about storytelling: giving background context, explaining intermediate observations, summarizing the most important insights. You can find helpful this article.
While in general the idea of defining functions is great, here probably they are not really necessary, since the corresponding pieces of code are used only once. By the way, good function naming anyway.
You may consider removing some obvious comments, like # Read the csv file into women_degrees data frame.
A good practice is to use a uniform quote mark style for the string data type in code cells throghout the project: or only single, or only double quote marks.

Hope my suggestions were of use. Good luck with your future projects!

Hi @AlJens
Thanks for sharing your project on Ebay Used Car Sales.The project looks cool and organized. Most of your comments, the explanations given in the markdown cell, are so informing. I can’t imagine that you managed this project by yourself, without checking into the solution, that’s a great move indeed and keep it up! buddy.
Have got few humble suggestions;

I think you need to do some extra work  on the introduction, like explaining further or clarifying more about  the Ebay cars, you will noticed that you have only provided the aim, and the links of the datasets.
In cell[8], you can have the whole code into  single line of code as an alternative, same to cell[10] and I think it will save you time and space, check below;

autos[""price""] = autos[""price""].str.replace(""$"", """").str.replace("","", """").astype(int)

Both will render same output.

Also recheck on your conclusion I think adding  more  findings will do better, like after cleaning the data, which  brand for example,you found to be most expensive although   it has been displayed in the output, typing it out will be much better .

Otherwise to me, I think everything looks nice, and just congratulating you for the good work.

"iOS: Found 2 duplicates, Reduced non-English apps by another 20",3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/ios-found-2-duplicates-reduced-non-english-apps-by-another-20/552167,"
Hi,

length column of header and length of columns  in list haven’t
any logical link  with each other.
For correct check of duplicates you must check besides app name yet apps versions,  size and rating. In IOS case duplicates have different versions, size and rating and formally are different applications. In android case name, rating, size and verison of duplicate are equal.
Why you only  delete row  [10472] - you are sure that google store dataset contains only one rating value more than 5, why you don’t check all values of rating? If somebody will reverse sort  google store dataset by name, rating  - what  value is in row 10472?  You a sure  that the google store dataset from dataquest that in ours project  and  dataset from kaggle have equal rows numbering.
In some discussions some people train model for google store   no remove NaN value and write science report about this ))
Remove non English apps - you a sure that name of application doesn’t contain from one or two character and  is combination from one Latin and one Asian - how our filter will be work in this case?
Trust but verify!

Star Wars project submission for review,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-project-submission-for-review/552094,"
Hi Ramón,
Thanks for sharing your first project with the Community and congratulations on completing the Data Scientist path!  You’ve done a nice job, your project is easy-to follow, well-structured, and with cool storytelling and conclusion. My favorite part is where you investigate the attitude to Star Wars by age. Also, good idea to use a dot plot for rankings by age.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to combine the code cells without output or markdown explanations right after them, for example [1] and [2], [12] and [13], [15] and [16].
You might consider creating a function for each type of plots, to avoid code repetition.
You can save the csv file in the same folder as your project notebook, so you won’t need to write a long path to the file.
It’s better to avoid empty lines after code comments and the code itself.
Visualizations: I’d suggest to increase the figures themselves, the font of the titles, to remove unnecessary spines on the plots (mostly the top and the right ones), to add y-label and values on the y-axis. The code cell [21]: here you might consider horizontal plots, given long names of the x-tick names.
There are some warnings around the project, it’s better to try to fix them.
A good practice is to put the column names in backticks when mentioning them in markdown.

Hope my ideas were useful. Good luck with your future projects!

Guided Project Review; Exploring Hacker News Posts,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-review-exploring-hacker-news-posts/552059,"
Hi @cameron_rex,
Thanks for sharing your project with us! It looks nice, you’ve done a good job!
Some suggestions from my side:

Your code is a bit over-commented. You might consider skipping some obvious comments like #convert that to an integer, #to begin, assign total_show to zero, #empty dictionary called comments_by_hour, etc.
Some code comments are also a bit too wordy and long. You can consider makig them more laconic, or divide them into 2 (or more) lines. Also, it’s better to avoid when a code comment is longer than the code lines themselves in given code cell, like it happened in the code cell [8].
The code cell [5]: this piece of information would look better in a markdown rather than in a code cell.
A good practice is to use font styles (bold, italic) only for emphasising, avoid over-using them. The same thing about using subheadings: only for a new section of a project.
Please remove the last empty code cell after the conclusion.

I hope my suggestions were useful. Happy learning!

Hi @dominikzalewski97
Thanks for sharing your first guided project on exploring ebay car sales. I have gone through your work and i found it well presented and structured. The introduction,  the aim of the project and the conclusion
are so informative.
Here are some notes :

I think could be a good idea to add more code comments so that when you go back to the project after a while it will be easier for you to remember some of the more complex steps.
Also It’s better to re-run the project when it’s completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
I noticed that you converted date columns to numeric type it sounds to me strange as it denied the fact that they are date could you explain your viewpoint please and if this was useful for your analysis? .

That’s all from my side. Hope it was helpful.

For Review: Answering Business Questions SQL Guided Project,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/for-review-answering-business-questions-sql-guided-project/550955,"
Hi @gosaints,
Wow, your project is really excellent!  Amazing and perfectly readable visualizations especially the pie charts with explode, perfect project structure, great storytelling and observations, cool idea to comment also sql code (and in general, code commenting in the whole perfect). Interesting idea to compare the appearances of the artists in playlists rather than the number of playlists for each. And once again, great approach to write both the conclusion and the methodology summary! I noticed also that, at the end, you decided to count the physical number of customers for each sales support agent 
Now some suggestions from my side:

The code cell [6], just an observation: the upper-left graph doesn’t have the grid, while the other have. Honestly,  I myself cannot figure out why.
It’s better to combine the code cells without any output or markdown observations afterwards, like [8]-[9], [10]-[11], [24]-[26], [36]-[37].
A long line of code, especially a function with many arguments, for example for creating a plot (like [6], [11], [15]) will be more easily-readable if to divide it into several lines. One argument for one line. For example, this code from the code cell [6]:

ax1 = sns.barplot(x=country_list, y='sales', data=country_stats, color=""steelblue"")

can be written in this way:
ax1 = sns.barplot(x=country_list, 
                  y='sales', 
                  data=country_stats, 
                  color=""steelblue"")


It’s better to follow a uniform style of quote marks for the string data in the code cells throughout the project (only single or only double).
For the code cell [12] you can consider using ORDER BY.
Styling the code in SQL, don’t forget to mind “rivers”.
It’s better to write the numbers in digits, in this sentence:


Seventy-four artists have zero units sold.


If you are also curious (so was I) how to decrease those huge spaces between the title of a pie chart and the pie chart itself (like in the code cells [20], [34]), I would suggest you the following approach that I had found somewhere on StackOverflow doing the same project:

ax.set_title(""My Pie Plot Title"", 
              fontsize=30, 
              y=0.9)

Let’s say, the main idea here is to tune the y parameter.
Hope that my suggetsions were of use.
Once again, awsome project!  Keep up this high level!

Up until the end I believed in a miracle: that Fandango indeed improved their rating system, but it didn’t happen 

I gazed the same , but after going through your project, the facts got exposed.
Mine therefore is to congratulate you for the good work and great inspirations you have ignited in this community.
Happy codding!

Guided Project_ Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/551871,"
Hi @edulopa0787
Thanks for sharing your project on  Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit survey. Have gone through your work which is very okay and well presented. The introduction has got recommendable information, the use of comments is so involving, the explanations given in the markdown cell , the conclusion , are so informing . Thumbs up mate for the good work. Just a suggestion, be very careful with typos, though have’t interacted with many , there is one I noticed in the explanations given in cell[133], I think the intention was to type ‘extract’ and not ‘extra’. Also consider deleting the last empty code cell, Otherwise , to me everything  are okay and just congratulating you for the good presentation. All the best in your upcoming projects.

SQL: CIA Factbook Data Analysis,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/sql-cia-factbook-data-analysis/551808,"
Hi @ywbadri,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community. You did an interesting analysis, good job! And yes, you shared everything correctly here 
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to exclude from the population analysis both World and Antarctica.
The code cell [12]: you’d better exclude British Indian Ocean Territory and Virgin Islands. They look strange and are just anomalous data in this database, you can follow this link for more information. Also, you can consider rounding the result to the second decimal here, to avoid having 0 for Afganistan.
In some parts of the project, I encountered </b> in markdown. It’s better to remove it everywhere.
A good idea is to put column names in backticks when referred in markdown explanations.
The code cell [4]: to avoid too long lines and for better readability, you can put the column names in SELECT in several rows.
As for the overall SQL style, you might find useful this guide, especially the section “White space” (so-called “rivers”).
Please remove the last empty code cell.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Good luck with your future projects!

Guided Project5: Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project5-visualizing-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/551802,"
Hi @shubhkirti.prasad,
Thanks for sharing your project. It looks great! Perfect project structure, emphasis where necessary, clean code, interesting observations.
Some suggestions from my side:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s already ready, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1. Well, this projects doesn’t have many code cells, I know  But for your future projects, it’s a good point to keep in mind.
Another good practice is to use a uniform quote mark style for the string data type in code cells throghout the project: or only single, or only double quote marks.
It’s recommended to avoid some obvious comments like # let’s import the libraries and read the dataset into a dataframe. Also, a good idea is to keep code comments as laconic as possible.
As for the conclusion, just the opposite, you might consider making it a little bit more wordy here, including some other important insights obtained in the project.
For this code:

    ax.spines[""right""].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines[""left""].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines[""top""].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines[""bottom""].set_visible(False)

you can consider using a for-loop.
Otherwise, everything is perfect, good job!
Hope my suggestions were useful.
Hapy learning!

Hi @kevinjhuang,
Thanks for sharing your first project with the Community. You’ve done a good job! And I totally agree with your that with pandas we’ll never get bored, there is always something new to discover and learn 
Some suggestions from my side for your consideration:

About the project structure. It’s better to add a title, a conclusion, probably to make the introduction a little more wordy giving some background context of the problem in question. You can find useful some ideas from this great article on the style of Data Science projects.
As for the code comments, they have to be, just the opposite, very laconic and imperative, communicating only the actions to be taken. All the observations, considerations, “why” and “how”, etc., go in markdown.
A good practice is to re-run the project when it’s already ready, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1. It can help to avoid confusion and other issues in future.
It’s better to combine subsequent code cells into one, if they don’t have any output or markdown explanations between them, like the code cells [400]-[402], [419]-[420], etc.
Be careful of typos.
A good practice is to use a uniform style of quote marks for string data in code cells: or only single, or only double. For example, in the code cell [410] you mixed both single and double quote marks for different strings. It’s better to choose one of these styles and then to be consistent with it throughout the whole project.

Hope my suggestions were of use.
Happy learning

Thanks for sharing your project  on Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data,.  The presentation is so cool and well organized. The codes as well have been well worked on and thus rendering  good output. Your conclusion is so informing and even the comments, it has been fun indeed reviewing your project. have got few humble suggestions;

I think it’s advisable to include the aim /goal/objectives when working on any project.
Consider having uniformity on the style, for example you find that most of the explanations you gave are in different style, some are in bold, some italic, others code format and so on.

Otherwise to me, everything is well represented and thumbs up for the representation.

Star Wars Survey (m201),4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-m201/551669,"
Hi @vadim.maklakov
Thanks for sharing your project on Investigating the star war survey.  I love  the entire presentation , the introduction has been well represented, the use of comments, the visualization is so good indeed. The conclusion as well is so informing, thumbs up for the entire work buddy. Have got two suggestions,

Systematic numbering  of the steps, sometimes can leads to mix up . I think the more better way is to group up the  stages, like data cleaning process, analyzing the data, as sub topic then you list up all the steps bounded to their corresponding stages. For example you list every   steps as you work on them under the data cleaning process and you do the same for Analyzing the data and so on.
take care  on the typos, more so when introducing a subtopic , for example your second subtopic I think  you meant Explore not Explre, And again the subtopic numbered 6, has # included.  Hope you will fixed on those.

Otherwise congratulations! for the good work .

Analyzing NYC High School Data (m217),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-nyc-high-school-data-m217/551615,"
Hi Vadim,
Thanks for sharing your project. It looks amazing! I liked a lot of things: very profound data analysis and insights (it’s evident that you were really curious about the data!), cool and clear visualizations, good code commenting, all the necessary links are present, including those on the side articles. Also, it was a great idea to include the scale of SAT results (what is considered to be best, average, poor, and the intermediate gradations). And another good idea was to figure out the misleading data on the AP test plot.
Some suggestions from my side:

The code cells [12]-[15]: you might consider creating a graph for all these new variables (less_equal_poor, etc), it will be easier to grasp the information then.
It’s better to include the introduction in the beginning and only after that to refresh all  the preparations we did in the previous missions.
I’d suggest you to rename those numbered conclusions around the project (“first conclusion”, etc.) into observations. Well, otherwise the word “conclusion” inside a project, especially if repeated, sounds a bit obligating  Anyway,  they should be shortly revised in the real conclusion in the end.
Throughout your project, I saw an issue with bullet/numbered lists (especially the one before the code cell [16]). Please use only one list type for the same list. I mean, a list can’t be both bullet and numbered sumultaneously.
It’s better to  use a uniform style for the quote marks used for string data in the code cells all around the project: or only single, or only double quote marks.
A good practice is to put the names of the columns or variables mentioned in markdown cells in backticks.

Hope my ideas were helpful. Great job indeed!

Guided Project_ Star Wars Survey,6,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-star-wars-survey/547847,"
What could we say? Another great notebook, you made beautiful charts ! Maybe some additional questions could arise from the project: why Han Solo is the favorite character and the least favorite – Jar Jar Binks? Someone who doesn’t know very well Star Wars will not be able to understand what is the problem with JJ Binks for example. So you could make a brief description of the character and it will become more clear.
Also  does favorite character or least favorite character learn us something about human nature (or about fan/non-fan nature) from a sociological point of view? Things like that so you will expand the original subject and explore other fields - sociology, psychoanalysis (Dark Vador and the very freudian “father’s question”), etc. You can write a kind of “open conclusion” with ideas and hypothesis “on the fly” for further explorations of the data.

Guided Project__Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL,10,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/548396,"
Hi Elena,
Congratulations for your project, I couldn’t stay without saying a word since you mentioned me in your post  (I was so glad to help the helper!) but I have been busy this week.
I know you always make a good work so not a suprise for me here, I appreciate the efforts you made in finding an equilibrium between text, titles and code, and also nice maps! A careful reader will note that you have been interested by the subject and that you spent time to investigate and learn more for your “general knowledge” (quoting you), and this is exactly what I like to do too!
By the way, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon is a French territory! My great-uncle I never known who died during WW2 was a  terre-neuvas and I always heard younger by his sister he fished for cod  - a 500 years old fishery - in this water area. Oh wait, should I say coastal waters? 
And at that time cross the Atlantic was quite an odyssey! Now see how sadly ends the story and what happened here: Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery.
Regarding your notebook, quickly (well, I will try):

the Summary of Results after the introduction is very welcome and make pro, but maybe it’s redundant with the conclusion and too dense?
population statistics: may be personal preferences, but why not showing the population by country in terms of percentage of world population? Prevalence is more informative to my opinion and will help the storytelling to develop.
birth rate, death rate, growth rate: you made special efforts here in being informative and it’s very stimulating. I was impatient to share my thoughts with you about it. There are statistics that deserves to be explored in global warming context since population growth is a serious concern. In fact, population growth started to explode in 18th-19th century in Europe and studies show that this is due to progress between others in hygiene, urbanism, water treatment, so less epidemics, etc. The first-order consequence of better life conditions is that child mortality decreased gradually. And what happened when child mortality decreases? People make less children and birth rate starts also to decrease. This is observed everywhere. So natural questions were arousing here: do the countries with lower death rates have also the lower birth rates? How strong the correlation is? Etc. Of course, these are just ideas on the fly that may interest you for future projects.

And that’s all for today!
Best
W.

Hi @krishna1519,
Welcome to the Community and thank you for sharing your project with us! 
You’ve done a good job: the overall project structure is nice, the code is clean and well-commented. Also, good usage of emphasizing (bold and italic for main points, backticks for the code in markdown).
Some suggestions from my side:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s already ready, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
You can consider adding more background information in the introduction, like a shore description of the Hacker News website.
It’s better to make the conclusion clearly separated from the rest of the text (I mean just adding the subheading Conclusion ). And it’s great that you calculated the time also for your country.
The code cell [9]: I would remove the last empty rows.

I hope my ideas were helpful.
Good job indeed! Happy learning and good luck with your future projects!

Thanks for sharing your project! Good storytelling, usage of emphasizing (bold font, bullet lists), and I agree with all your observations. Also, it was a good idea to order by / group by column name and not by number. Well done!
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to re-run the notebook when it’s already finished, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Please add an overall conclusion in the end of your project.
There are several occurencies of confusion in the numbering of your subheadings. In fact, I’d suggest you not to use this numbering at all.

Guided Project: Graph Visualization For Gender Gap in College Degrees,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-graph-visualization-for-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/551452,"
Hi Bruce,
Thanks for sharing your project! Well-commented code, easy-to-follow storytelling flow, and interesting observations. Good job!
Here are some comments from my side:

To make the project more concise, you can consider gathering all the code cells starting from [3] into one code cell. Then you can put all the technical details for each part of that giant cell as short code comments before each corresponding piece of code. Practically, only the code cell [7] will remain afterwards, probably with more comments added to it.
It’s better to remove the numbering from the subheadings names (especially numbers with 0, like 1.0, looks a bit weird).
A good practice is to follow a uniform style for quote marks for the string data: or only single, or only double.
You might consider re-phrasing a bit the introduction and conclusion. Instead of mentioning that the goal was to practice visualizations and that there were no specific questions to be answered, you can say that the scope was to analyze the data available to understand if there was/is a gender gap for different study fields, if the situation has been recently changing or not, etc. I  know that it’s just a project for studying, but you can imagine that it’s a real working project.
It’s better to remove the text in red from the project and put it as a question in Q/A section of the Community. By the way, I don’t know the answer  But at least this line plt.savefig('biology_degrees.png') worked correctly? Have you found the file in the same folder as your project notebook?

Hope my suggestions were useful. Happy learning!

Hi David,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your first project with us! Good job!
Here is my feedback, hope it will be usefull:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Please add a conclusion to your work, summarizing the most important insights.
You can consider using more markdown explanations throughout the project for discussing intermediate results and planning next steps. Actually, I’d transform some of your subheadings (like "" Print dataset headers"", "" Use the dictionary you created above to remove the duplicate rows"" and some others) into ordinary markdown cells.
From the other subheadings, it’s better to remove “Step N”, just leaving the name of the subheading itself.
Don’t forget to add comments to your code when it’s necessary, explaining what exactly each part does, especially for the functions.
For your future projects, you can find this article a good resource.

That’s all from my side. Hope it was helpful.

Hi!
I’ve enjoy reading your project, good job! I’ve recently finished same one, so I was very interested how you did all the tasks.
It’s very well structured and I like all your explanations .However I think it would be better if you would keep your code cell shorter(I mean split it for few extra) For me it was sometimes hard to follow your code and output.
In[5:] I’m not sure why are you overcomplicating by writing a function instead just apply new names as a dictionary.
In[15:] You can calculate top8 like this: sum(autos['brand'].value_counts().head(8)) I would avoid typing data manually, since if you data change your calculation will be wrong.
Same for Percent_of_total_cars : sum(autos['brand'].value_counts(normalize=True).head(8)) use normalize=True for percentages.
7.1 I like your comment about Pareto Principle, very interesting!
In[16:] I would use simpler code, you don’t have to use all elif.
top8 = autos['brand'].value_counts().index[:8]
mean_price = {} 
for brand in top8:
    selected_rows = autos[autos['brand'] == brand]

Hi @jesmaxavier
Thanks for sharing your project on Analyzing NYS High School  Data. The presentation is so cool, I love your introduction, the goal, the conclusion, they are so informative and thumbs up buddy . Including table of content when  working on a projects, is a good idea and going forward I’ll have to adapt the same. Your visualization walkthrough is just excellent, the scatter plots, bar  plots  all are well presented.
Mine therefore is to congratulate you for the good work  and wishing you a happy learning !

Hi @drill_n_bass,
Thanks for sharing your project! And I also noticed that you mentioned me in it, thanks a lot!!!   I’m glad that my suggestions were useful! 
Your project looks very nice, well-structured, well-commented where necessary, with a thorough analysis and interesting insights. Also, good emphasis of the main ideas and intermediate conclusions (using italic and bold). And finally it’s not only me who thinks that it’s not so strange to have free cars on eBay! 
Here are some suggestions from my side, hope they will be interesting:

While you wrote intermediate conclusions after different sections of your project, it’s still a good practice to write also a general conclusion at the end of the project, with the most important results.
Please add a link on the original dataset in the introduction (or the modified version, since you mentioned that the original is not available anymore).
A good idea is to use backticks when mentioning column names in markdown cells. Then they will be more eye-catching.
I would omit giving technical details and describing in markdown cells different methods and how they work (for example, those right before the code cells [4],  [10], and [21]). The reader can always find them in the documentation (hopefully in the last edition ). Alternatively, you can add these technical details as short comments in the code cells.
About the code commenting now. Your code is rather well-commented, only that I would place each comment before the code lines it describes (i.e., not laterally). For example, in the code cells [21], [29], and some others. Well, if a comment is really very short (1-3 words), it’s ok also to put it laterally.
You’d better remove all the commented-out code from the project (since you don’t use it anymore), like in the code cell [30] .
The code cells [21]-[23]: you can use print('\n') to visually separate all the printed outputs.
About between() (it seems that you had doubts about it in the code cell [16]): by definition, it includes both limits.
I noticed you tend to use (print()) instead of print(). It’s not  an issue, but the external parenthesis are redundant, better to remove them.
The code cell [33]: I wouldn’t convert datetime data into int.
The code cell [31]: here it’s better to use unique() instead of autos to check “suspicious” columns which potentially can contain German words.

That’s all from my side. Good job indeed!
Happy learning and good luck with your further projects!

Welcome to this community and thank you very much for sharing your project on Exploring Hacker News.  Your project looks good, the introduction,  the aim, comments are well presented.  Explanations given while working on the average number  of comments is nicely presented and thumbs up for that buddy.
Most of the outputs  for example in  cell[1]( exploring the data) have been displayed horizontally and I think for readability  ,you ought to have applied for loop for such outputs to have them displayed vertically.
Otherwise congratulations for the good work and just wishing  you the best in your upcoming projects;

Hi @radiofireworks,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your great project!  Perfect project structure and using of subheadings, good emphasis (bold font, bullet points), cool storytelling and profound data analysis, super-well-commented code, all the necessary links are present, including the one referring to the Statista website. Good practice to check the length of a dataframe before and after dropping rows. Also, I liked your usage of the hexagonal bin plot, and in the code cell [16] – good idea to put a 50% line. Well done indeed!
Some suggestions from my side, hopefully helpful:

About the comments. In some code cells (for example, [6], [12], [13]) the comment lines are too long, maybe you can consider dividing them into several lines, or probably reducing them. Then, the code cell [22] - here you really over-commented your code  I would suggest you to reduce the comments here to the most important details. For the rest, as I’ve already said, your code is commented just in an excellent way!
When you mention column names in the markdown cells, it’s better to always include them in backticks, to make them more eye-catching.
The code cell [7]: you can consider using a for-loop here, to avoid code repeating.
The code cell [20]: in the cases like this, when there are a lot of bars and long x-tick labels, it’s better to use a horizontal bar plot.
A good practice is to divide long lines of code with many arguments into several lines. For example, in the code cell [16], you can divide this line:

ax1 = recent_grads[:10].plot.bar(x='Major', y='ShareWomen', ylim=(0,1), ax = axs[0], legend=False, color=""lightblue"",
                                 title=""Share of women in top 10 majors"")

into these several lines:
ax1 = recent_grads[:10].plot.bar(
                                 x='Major', 
                                 y='ShareWomen', 
                                 ylim=(0,1), 
                                 ax = axs[0], 
                                 legend=False, 
                                 color=""lightblue"",
                                 title=""Share of women in top 10 majors""
                                 )

One argument per one line. In this way, we can improve the readability of the code. The same approach you can apply to the other code cells that output graphs (especially those with a lot of arguments, i.e. more than 3).

It would be good to despine the plots, remove redundant ticks, and increase titles. You’ll learn all these techniques in the next course “Storytelling Through Data Visualization” and then afterwards can return to this project and apply all those plot aesthetics.

Hope my ideas were useful.
Great job your project, congratulations!

Hi @ibragimovagim
Welcome to this community and thanks  for sharing  your project  on Profitable App Profiles for the Apps Store and Google Play markets. Your introduction, the comments , use of markdown cell is  so informative and thumbs up for the good work. I love the explanations you gave  based on the observation  made on the most common genres, it’s well detailed indeed.
I think  using an empty print() command for spacing is not  that good and instead yo can add a new line , that is print(""\n"").

Hi @shubhkirti.prasad
Thank you for sharing your project  on Exploring the Hacker News Post. Your project is well detailed and nicely presented. The introduction is  so informative  and so organized. Have got few humble suggestions to pass out;

It’s always recommended to provide the link of the dataset you are using that is in the introduction, and giving more background information of these datasets.
Some of the outputs needed  bit of explanations, like in cell[60] it has heavy information that it shouldn’t be without  explanation at all.
Also, always consider re-running your entire project after you have finished, that is, in the kernel bar, to have the ordering of the cell, from first(one) to the last.

Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and congratulations for having presented the good work. Wishing  you all the best in your upcoming projects.

Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees (m149),4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/visualizing-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees-m149/551057,"
Hi Vadim,
Well, yes, this project seems to be the shortest one to everybody  Perfect that you have successfully resolved the issue with the subplots!
Some comments from my side:

I would recommend you to expand a bit both introduction and conclusion. In the introduction, you can consider something like according to a diffused opinion, there is a gender gap in college degrees, etc., Probably add some other general words: that we are going to find out if it’s true or not, etc. In the conclusion, you can analyse the resulting graphs: where this gap really exists and where not. Maybe for some degrees it has been increasing, decreasing, or even swapping over the past years.
It’s better to use a uniform quote marks style for the string data type in the code cells throughout the project.
Almost senseless suggestion in case of this short project, but a good practice anyway: to re-run an already ready project.
For this piece of code:

ax.spines[""right""].set_visible(False)    
ax.spines[""left""].set_visible(False)
ax.spines[""top""].set_visible(False)    
ax.spines[""bottom""].set_visible(False)

you can consider using a for-loop.

A long line of code, especially a function with many arguments, can be divided into several lines for better readability (one argument per one line). For example, this line:

ax.plot(women_degrees['Year'], 100-women_degrees[stem_cats[sp]], c=cb_orange, label='Men', linewidth=3)    

can be divided in the following way:
ax.plot(
        women_degrees['Year'], 
        100-women_degrees[stem_cats[sp]], 
        c=cb_orange, 
        label='Men', 
        linewidth=3
        )
    


In this piece of code:

# Label for men
ax[j,i].text(2006, 89, 'Men')
# Label for women
ax[j,i].text(2004, 25, 'Women')

you might regulate the heights of labels “Men” and “Women” (89 and 25) relative to the graphs themselves (to put them closer to the graphs).

It’s better to remove the empty box plot from  the second set of graphs.

Hope my suggestions were useful.
Happy learning!

Below is an alternative of renaming the columns and will render the same output as yours, though it’s like time consuming by entering all the column names but I think it’s more readable.

I love the way you have grouped your findings , that is, in the conclusion ,never imagined before to present it the way you have done, thumbs up for the good work buddy!
Having said that, have got few observation to point out.

It is advisable that every time  you use groupby() method you should always remember to reset the indexes back to their position ( do not create new object) , and to achieve this , apply reset_index()on your new dataframe.
It’s also advisable to rerun your entire project that is, after you have finished working on that project, to have the ordering of the cell from the first(one)   to the last.

Otherwise to me, everything looks nice and just congratulating  you for the good work. And please  consider above as  a humble point out.

Hi Emmeline,
Welcome to the Community and thanks for sharing your project! 
You did a great job! Your project shows a good structure, clean code, interesting markdown explanations and insights. And it’s a good idea to emphasize in bold the most important ideas.
Just a few suggestons from my side for your consideration:

It’s better to re-run the project when it’s already completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
When you refer to some column names in markdown text (or when you want to put a piece of code in markdown), a good idea is to enclose such a name into backticks (``), to improve its readability.
The code cell [1]: if you have your csv file in the same folder as your notebook (which is always a good practice to follow), then you don’t have to write the whole path to the file to open it, just its name is enough.
It’s better to avoid using numers, letters, or any other markers with the section subheadings: they are sometimes difficult to follow for a reader, and also for you it’s easy to make a mistake with them. Instead, you can use headings of different levels.
The markdown paragraph before the code cell [11]. You might consider putting the most important technical details as the comments inside the code cell itself, while leaving in markdown mostly the discussion of the results and insights.
Be careful to avoid typos, especially in the subheadings and titles.
In the markdown text before the code cell [21], there is a sentence:


Now, we would like to investigate the games that have the most users.

Here, I suppose, you wanted to say “genres” rather than “games”?
I hope my feedback was helpful to you. Good luck with your future projects and happy learning!

I agree with you that this project is easier compared to the first one, though there could be many reasons, I think one of the reasons is to the fact that you had to work with the two datasets  and compare the results in every step, this is just too much for a beginner.

Guided Project: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors. Request for Feedback,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors-request-for-feedback/550918,"
Hi @sergibtrader
Thanks for sharing your project! Good work on a thorough completion of this project. Here are a few comments:

Good, to-the-point observations in the first part of the analysis. The only thing I am not sure about is the common meaning of columns ‘Sample_size’ and ‘Total’. More on this later.
Narratively, it is often better to explain why you’re doing something before you do it. For example, in the scatter plots, histograms and bar plots parts of your project, you start right away with the plots. It makes it confusing to the reader, who does not know what you’re trying to achieve
Speaking of plots, I do like the attention you gave to yours. All of them do look quite nice!
The Total vs Sample_size section is confusing. What are you trying to prove exactly? It seems to me that you want to show that the Total and Sample_size columns “move together”, and thus large sample size is the same thing as large total. Why not then use the tools introduced by the project? A scatter plot of these two columns would immediately and visually show this.
On the grouped bar plot section: nice that your explained your objectives at the start! It would have been nice to give a conclusion too.
I like what you did to color the box plots.
I agree with your two conclusions, but it could be useful to elaborate.

On last point, that is not directly related to data analysis or coding: try to be mindful of your spelling and grammar. This always improves the reading experience!
Finally, it seems that this last hexagonal plot worked in the notebook you linked. Thus I won’t comment on your question, as I’m not sure what could have happened.
All in all, congratulations on the nice project! Don’t be afraid to write a bit more. Good luck with your next projects, and happy learning!

Hi @amabel
Welcome to this community and thanks for sharing your project on Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Majors . Your code lines are so cool thus rendering good output, the comments as well have been nicely presented, thumbs for the good work. Have got few suggestions;

I think it would be more better to have wider explanation in the introduction, telling in details the information background of the data set  you are using, giving the aim of the project  and so on.
Some of the outputs needed explanations like in cell [99],[101] and others , hope you will checked onto that.
Also recheck on the conclusion, it would be more better giving the results of your findings in summary way , like what you found interesting maybe in the category like STEM.
Lastly, it’s always advisable to rerun the entire project , that is by pressing on the kernel (at the bar) to have the sequential arrangement of your cell form the first to the last.

Hi @JamesDiu,
Thanks for sharing your project. You’ve done a good job!  I especially liked your very neat visualizations, well-structured and easy-to-follow code, and the way you defined the majority of your functions, with all the necessary descriptions and comments (and in general, in was a great idea to introduce all those functions for this project).
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

There are some warnings around the project. You can think of how to fix them, or, alternatively, just suppress them  This code would be useful for this purpose:

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


I would suggest to you to add a more expanded introduction to the project, including the link to the dataset you used, and also a conclusion summarizing the obtained insights.
A good practice is to re-run the already ready project, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Also, a good idea is to use a uniform style of the quote marks for the string data type all around the project: or only single, or only double.
The code cell [8]: here you can consider applying a for-loop for despining the plots (for all ax.spines)
It’s better to unite the subsequent code cells if they don’t have any output or any markdown comments directly after them. For example, [1]-[2], [3]-[5], [8]-[9], and some others.
The code cells [9]-[11] (well,  actually it derives from the code cell [8]). Here it’s better to remove the legend (since it consists only of one item), and also not to rotate x-ticklabels, since they are just short numbers.

Hope my ideas were useful.

Hi @jmerrell247,
Thanks for sharing your project with the Community! It looks nice, well-structured, with clean and well-commented code and good markdown explanations.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

It’s better to use “we” instead of “I” throughout the project.
I would re-phrase a little bit the introduction, since the context suggested by the DQ instructions (that we are working as data analysts in that company, etc.), is indeed hypothetical.
You can mention that you decided to use the Posts table from the database, since there are plenty of others.
Some obvious code comments (like # Import pandas, # View first 5 rows) can be omitted.
About the visualizations. It’s better to despite them, make titles bigger, remove the legend if it only contains 1 item (like in the code cells [10] and [11]). Also, a good idea is to create horizzontal bar plots instead of vertical, because here we have a lot of bars, and using horizontal bar plots would improve their readability. Finally, you might consider defining a  function for creating these  plots (since they are all created according to the same scheme, you won’t have to repeat the same piece of code).
Probably, you can add a couple of words about why we became interested exactly in deep learning and not in the super-popular machine learning.

That’s all from my side, hope it was helpful! I saw that you shared a lot of other projects recently, but for now I myself still haven’t done them, so my suggestions there would probably be less interesting 
Happy coding!

Thank you for sharing your  project on Analyzing High School Data. Most of the  projects you do share , have been widening my thinking on data analysis. For this, Your introduction has exposed me to more information I wasn’t aware of about New York City. Information background of the data is just  excellent, talking of SAT by how you have provided the details on each section, is just wonderful . I Never used some libraries like the cartopy, they have rendered out nice  charts and looking forward to include them in my upcoming projects where necessary.
Mine therefore is to congratulate you for the good presentation, from the introduction, data cleaning process, combining the data , the analysis, the conclusion is just excellent, thumbs up baddy for the good work.

Hi Ulugbek,
Welcome to the Community and thank you for sharing your project!
You code is clean and well-organized, and the obtained results are correct. I would recommend you, though, to add more markdown text to it and, in general, more structure: introduction, conclusion, subheadings for each section, a link to the original dataset. You may find this resource useful for these purposes.
Some other suggestions from my side:

It’s better to skip some obvious comments (#printing the header, #returns Boolean result), while to add the comments to more tricky pieces of code (for example, the one about swapping, etc.).
A good practice is to re-run the project when it’s already finished, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
The code cell [8]: I would divide in into 2 lines for better readability, putting the second argument of the long print() (len(hn) ==... etc.) on a new row.
The code cells [15] and [17]: here you can consider rounding the results.
Subsequent code cells without output and without markdown explanations afterwards can be united ([1] and [2], [4]-[6]]).

Hope my suggestions were helpful. Happy learning!

Probably, it’s better to expand both the introduction and especially the conclusion, and to list what questions we are going to explore and what insights we got. Of course, this is just a DQ guided project for studying, but doing it you were curious about the data and potential insights anyway, and indeed, you did a great job. So no reason to be shy, you should describe in the introduction your goals apart from studying and in the conclusion - the obtained results.
About SQL queries, you can find useful this SQL style guide, especially take a look at the section “Spaces” (about so-called “rivers”).
It’s better to use “we” than “I” in a project, and especially avoid the passive voice, according to yet another cool guide.

Hope it was useful. Good luck with your future projects and keep up this high level!

Looking For Feedbacks For The Guided Project 1,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/looking-for-feedbacks-for-the-guided-project-1/550440,"
Hi @gehadeltabakh,
Congratulations on finishing the first guided project and Welcome to the community. The first one is a long one and a difficult one for someone who is an absolute beginner. I also had similar difficulties when I started this project. And yes, I had to look at the solution notebook to get guidance and validation at almost each steps. So personally, I think it is okay not to have our own strategy for this first project. After all the aim of these projects are to guide us to learn better. As long as we are learning something from it, I think it is okay.
Coming to your project, it looks good. You have nicely structured and given suitable headings. I think could be a good idea to add more code comments so that when you go back to the project after a while it will be easier for you to remember some of the more complex steps.
Other than that I don’t think there is anything more to add. You have followed the instructions quite well and everything looks good. Happy learning.

Hi @philiplibre
Thanks for sharing your project on Cleaning and Analyzing  Employee Exit Survey. All your steps are very recommendable , the introduction, the aim/goal, use of the comments, data cleaning process , analysis part are just on another level, keep it up buddy!. I love the way you have set out the threshold to eliminate some of the columns. For me, I  used 500 and I think going for average is the best option just as you did. Visualization is just on another level, you have  perfectly presented  the  pie charts, with values presented as percentage ,looking forward to do the same in my project.
Mine is therefore to congratulate you  for good presentation and just wishing you a happy learning!

Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL - Xy,6,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql-xy/549584,"
Hi @bounski,
Thanks for sharing your amazing project with the Community! It looks so unusial and eye-catching, like a interesting blog post about the countries around the world! I liked plenty of things in your project: attractive title, cover image, other cool pictures, both funny and informative (like the one about the types of “waters”), mentioning the year when the factbook was issued, your curiousity about your own country’s statistics, good usage of aliases for the columns, very original and even humorous storytelling style, which definitely makes your project different and sparks interest. And yes, Antarctica and Pitcairn are also on my bucket list! 
Now some “boring” suggestions from my side, hopefully useful anyway 

A good practice is to re-run the whole project when it’s already completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
It’s better to use “we” throughout the project rather than “I”.
The code cell [20]: you should exclude also Antarctica and European Union.
The code cell [153]: you can divide long code lines in 2 or more lines for better readability.
The code cell [129]: it’s enough to cast into float or only numerator, or only denominator, not necessarily both of them. This will make the code cleaner.
You might find helpful this SQL style guide, especially the section “Spaces” (so-called “rivers”).

Once again, great job, congratulations! Hope to see more projects from you soon! 
P.S. I added your notebook to nbviewer for easier access.

Hi Ivan,
I’m doing the same project now. My approach is different from yours, but your project looks perfect anyway! It’s a great idea to query the DSSE yourself instead of using the available dataframe (well, I did the same ). Perfect introduction to the problem, in-depth conclusion, project structure in general, clean code, great visualizations, interesting markdown observations. Also, very curious analysis about Python and R. This time the navigation works smoothly.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

Probably it’s better to remove from the introduction the details on how to fetch the number of sites on StackExchange: indeed, this information is merely mentioned on their home page 

The pieces of SQL queries: better to divide them into several lines for better readability, according to the SQL style guide.
The code cell [7]: you can combine these code lines in one.
The chapter “Analyzing the Deep Learning Trend”. You probably should mention before it, or right in the beginning of this chapter, why exactly we are interested in deep learning.
Some technical details in markdown (like those between the code cells [7]-[11], or between these ones[13]-[15]) can fit better as comments in the corresponding code cells.

Well, nothing else to add from my side. Awsome work, keep up this high level!

Thanks for sharing your project! It looks great: very well-structured and well-commented, good emphasizing of the most important observations, cool story-telling style, profound data analysis and interesting ideas, good function-naming, and clean code.
A few suggestions to you, hopefully helpful:

Please add a conclusion to summarize the most important insights obtained in your project.
I would suggest you to substitute ''you"" with “we”, for the sake of consistency. I saw it somewhere in your project.
It’s better to re-run the whole project when it’s already completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Another good practice is to delete all the commented-out pieces of code, since they don’t serve anymore.

Great job indeed, congratulations!

Hi @wolewani
Congratulations for having completed the project on Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors. Have gone through your projects and the presentation is nice, thumbs up for that.
 wolewani
Any comments in regards to this project is welcome
Have got few suggestions to make;

Your projects lacks a title which to me, is very key when working on any project . For example in your case, adding  “Visualize Earning Based on College Majors” will do as a project title.
If you check  the first code cell, I think the intension was to print out as well the fifth line and it didn’t happen after adding another line… To achieve the output, apply the print() function.
Some of the outputs like in cell[7] are too lengthy. Explaining each step is okay, But I think in cases where you are trying to reduce or remove the missing rows, you could have just  used df.shape[0] to show the current number of rows and the final number as it will saves space.
Also recheck on your plots(scatter plots), some of them are empty. Though still figuring out what could have been the problem, you can check both on x limit and y limit.
Lastly, am longing for your conclusions, what are some of your findings (presented in  a summary way).Hope you will fixed it up.

Consider above as a humble suggestions.
Happy learning!

Congratulations on finishing another project. Your project looks good. You’ve done it with very minimal number of lines of code! That is great.
It would be great if you could re-run all the cells before submitting. Looks like there is an error showing in output cell 6.
Another thing is
for key, spine in ax.spines.items():
            spine.set_visible(False)

Can also be written using ax.spines.values() then you can just use one variable alone for iterating.

Star Wars Survey Guided Project for review,5,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-guided-project-for-review/550162,"
Hi @gosaints,
Thank you for sharing your project. It looks amazing: well-organized, with perfect visualizations, all the necessary links, clean code, very interesting observations (especially about education level and who shot first). You didn’t use much markdown description of your workflow, but your code is perfectly commented (and only where it’s necessary), and you added all the intermediate observations after each section, so your project is easy-to-follow anyway. Also, good idea to add the methodology summary.
Some suggestions from my side:

To avoid code repetition, you can consider creating a function for plotting all the grouped bar plots.
Probably, it’s better to add some more subheadings in the chapter on data cleaning (for different groups of columns to be cleaned).
A good practice is to combine code cells without output into one code cell ([3]-[4], [8]-[9], [21]-[22]).
For a long line of code with arguments, like this one from the code cell [13]:

ax = sns.barplot(data=star_wars_gender_melt, x='variable', y='value', hue='Gender', ci=None)


you can divide it into several lines, for better readability:
ax = sns.barplot(
                 data=star_wars_gender_melt, 
                 x='variable', 
                 y='value', 
                 hue='Gender', 
                 ci=None
                 )

One argument for one row. The same thing for the code cells [35] and [39]. This approach is especially good when there are a lot of arguments.
Hope my ideas were helpful.
Great job your project! Keep this high level.

Guided Project: Using SQL to Answer Business Questions (Chinook Music Store),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-using-sql-to-answer-business-questions-chinook-music-store/549899,"
Hi Ivan,
Thanks for sharing your project! It looks really awsome: perfectly structured, properly styled SQL queries, thorough analysis, curious insights, interesting approaches, including comparing full album vs individual track purchases and comparing tracks available and sales popularity (even though I agree that this question was a bit confusing). I liked also your navigation and conclusion sections, and it was a cool idea to use the JULIANDAY() function. Also, this observation looks curious:

I would ask internally why Punk is paired with Alternative in the genre title. There is already an “Alternative” genre. This can possibly cause new “Alternative” tracks to be mistakenly categorized as “Alternative & Punk”. This can lead to bad data and cause customer dissatisfaction.

Now some ideas from my side:

About creating views, I also have an impression that it’s more common to use subqueries instead. It seems like with defining functions in Python: unless you’re going to use a certain code several times, there is no need to create a function. However, I agree with you that making a preview is a good idea (like in your “Purchases by Country” chapter). Well, on the other hand, you can preview this code also without creating a view, and then use the same code with WITH command in the next code cell. Anyway, you can combine the code cells [14] and [15] into one view, since you’re not going to use this invoice_usa more than one time (exactly for creating the next view).
The code cells [3] - [13]: probably it’s better to limit the preview of the available tables to 2-3 of them, also because the contents of many of them are quite self-explanatory from the database schema.
In some code cells (17, 23, 25, 27-29, 31-33, 35) there are too big white spaces between the commands and the statements themselves.
After the code cell [28] I would add some observation about how we can use (or whether we should use) this information further.
The code cell [30]: probably, I missed something, but why are we  using here WHERE track_id > 2012 ? What does this 2012 mean?
The markdown cell after [24] and another one after [32]. Please remove the bullet points from the lists if you 're going to use numbered lists instead.

I hope my suggestions were of help to you.
Great job your project!

You have done an amazing job with this project. You have gone above and beyond the instructions given and done a great analysis. The logical flow was great.
There are many small details you have added such as creating a function to replace the special characters, that add beauty to this project.
My only suggestion would be to print a few lines of autos in the report. While reading the project report, the whole dataset comes a few times and it takes a few extra scrolling to get to the bottom of it.
After going through your code, I did expect a bit more of extra analysis from your project. Maybe it was already long and you didn’t want to go into other areas of the data. Anyway, this is a great project. Keep up the good work.

Feedback on guided project: Star Wars survey,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-on-guided-project-star-wars-survey/549272,"
Hi Vivek,
Thank you for your kind words! I’m very glad that my project was helpful! Especially because yours looks a great job: perfectly structured, very well-commented, exhaustive and coherent storytelling, interesting and eye-catching title (only that, probably, it’s better to remove the dot at the end). The visualizations are amazing (my favourite one is the graph on the most controversial characters), with emphasizing the bars of interest and good choice of color palette. It was a cool idea to add the link on the article about Jar Jar Binks and why he is disliked by many viewers; also, the reasonings behind Han Solo being a favourite character are quite solid. In addition, very good remark in the conclusion, about what the further Star Wars movies would look like in terms of their popularity.
About the last 3 questions of the project, from my point of view, your approach technically is very efficient and comprehensive, including the visualizations, as I said. Personally, I can’t see where and why it can be modified. Instead, here are some suggestions from my side, mostly about some details and cosmetics:

It’s better to re-run the whole project after having finished it, in order to have all the cells in order, starting from 1.
For the sake of consistency, it’s better to use uniform quote marks for the string type of data throughout the project (or only single, or only double quote marks).
For the last 3 questions (Q4, Q5 and Q6), you forgot to add the corresponding numbers of questions in the subheadings.
The code cells [104] and [105]: it’s better to rename the variables bool to avoid confusion, since bool is a data type in Python.
The code cell [106]. You should pass these two arguments in reset_index():

star_wars.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

Then the old index will be dropped and the new one will start from 0…

The code cells [109], [111], [114]. Here a FutureWarning happened, even though the graphs, thankfully, are shown anyway. It seems to be a version issue of the DQ platform. You can refer to this discussion about how to resolve it.
I would remove the code cell [113], it repeats the information from the cell above.
The code cell [119] also should be removed (some draft code commented out).
Probably it’s better to increase the graph titles, especially for the graphs [123] and [134].
The code cells [124], [128], [130]. I would add print('\n'), right as you did for some previous similar cases.

Once again, great project, well done! Good luck with your future projects and keep this high level! 
Merry Christmas!

Congratulations for having completed  the guided project on Exploring Hacker News. Your code looks so nice, the introduction so informative. The way you have  worked on  statistic for date and time dispersion  is more than great, Thumbs up  for that. Have just few suggestions;

I think it’s would be better to exclude the word Guided Project that is when introducing the title of your project.
Be very keen on the typos, like if you check your introduction the word ‘post’ has been type as 'posttt`.Also the explanation you gave based on percentage, you have commas in the percentage values.
Your conclusion looks good, However I think it would be better to include the findings(in the conclusion) as well just in a summary way.

Otherwise, to me everything is okay.
Happy learning!

My Guided Project: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-guided-project-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/549460,"
Hi @lukeayobami56
I have gone through your work and honestly I loved the way you have presented your work. Analyzing Employee Exit Survey hasn’t become easy to many me included, hope this wasn’t your case. Congratulations indeed for the good work. Have got few suggestions;

In cell [8] I think it would be better if you indicated why you have used the na_values parameter , if you keenly checked the comments you have just pointed out that you are reading the dete_survey csv files again.
In cell [19] I can see you have used vectorization to extract the years

# Extracting The Years Using Vectorized String Methods.
dete_resignations['cease_date'] = dete_resignations['cease_date'].str.split('/').str[-1]
dete_resignations['cease_date'] = dete_resignations['cease_date'].astype('float')

As an alternative , you can also use the regex just in one line code . have a look;
dete_resignations['cease_date'] =dete_resignations['cease_date'].astype('str')str.extract(r""(\d+\/(\d+)"").astype(""float"")


Also in cell [29] when combining the data, you have indicated in the markdown cell that you are combining the data sets but coming to code cell you added as well a new column institute. This  may create a different meaning that is, one may assume that before combining the datasets you need to add specific columns to the given dataframe. Though you have explained the entire working, below the given code cell, I think  the best way was to separate the two task, adding the new column  and then combining the datasets or rather include detailed information of the two task in the markdown cell.

Consider above as humble suggestions , Happy learning!

The story telling part is just on another level. Most  of your explanations are so enjoyable and I found myself going through them over and over again.

Second Guided Project: Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/second-guided-project-visualizing-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/549988,"
Hi Christoph,
Your project is super-cool, even if it was supposed to be a small one! The approach that you used is very interesting and different from the one suggested in the instructions. The project itself is perfectly structured, the code clean, well-commented and easily readable. The storytelling and observations are interesting and easy-to-follow. Great approach to define all the functions and then use them in the final code. Also, your function names are very clear, and using a description inside each function was a good idea. Congratulations, indeed! 
The only advice from my side this time will be to keep apart introduction and conclusion. I mean, you definitely already have these 2 sections in your project. Practically what I suggest is just to include “Introduction” and “Conclusion” as subheadings  Alternatively, you can leave the insights at the end of your project as they are, but then add a short conclusion, summarizing al those observations in a more concise way.
Great job your project! I’m sure now that you’ll become a data champion  very soon!

Guided Project 3: Ebay Sales - Feedback greatly appreciated,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-3-ebay-sales-feedback-greatly-appreciated/549939,"
Hi @nyaneba1,
Thanks for sharing your project. It looks really nice: very well-structured, the code clean and well-commented, interesting storytelling and insights. Also, it was a good idea to include a description of the function in the code cell [26]. Great job!
Below are some suggestions from my side:

A good practice is to re-run the project when it’s already completed. In this way, you will  have all  the code cells in order and starting from 1.
Please add a conclusion to your project, summarizing the most important observations.
The code cell [6]: here you can simply use the rename() method. But of course also your code is correct.
The code cell [8]: to make the code cleaner, you can combine the first 3 lines in one (and the same about the second 3 lines).
The code cells [12], [13], and [14]: also here it’s better to combine the code in one line, for each of these cells.
About the lowest limit for price as 50$: when I was doing this project, I found some forums (unfortunately, in Russian) discussing that on the German eBay there are really some cars free of charge. But definitely, they represent very small percentage (3% of the whole dataset), so just removing them is also a solid approach in this case.

Hope my ideas were helpful. All in all, your project is very good and well-organized, congratulations!
Happy learning!

Hi @mamun216
Congratulations for having completed your  second project in Analyzing hacker news. Your project looks really fine and the code part is well presented.

 mamun216
how should make it more better or is it follows the guided project as should be data science project like following steps intro, objective, sub heading, result, conclusion.

I Love the way you have brought out the introduction, the use of comments and markdown cell. However I think you conclusion need more clarification. To my understanding , I think what you gave as the “Result Summary” at the last working of your project, should be  in the conclusion. In the conclusion I don’t think if it is enough just to point out your walkthrough in the projects but in addition, you should summarize the end goals with some little explanations.
Consider above as a humble suggestions,.
Happy Learning!

Hi Vadim,
Congratulations on finishing your first project!
First of all, for your future projects, it’s highly recommended to use these guidelines. Then it will be much easier for the community members to open and review your projects. By the way, this time I re-categorized your project, because initially you put it in a wrong section (“QA” instead of “Share-Guided Project”).
Now about the project itself. I was very impressed with your super-advanced code, with perfectly commented functions exactly in the way they should be commented if they are really supposed to be used for further work. Your functions even double-check if the input data is correct, and throw an error otherwise. Then, pretty-printing tables was a great idea, they really look cool in this way. Also, I liked that you tracked the number of rows in both datasets at each step of data cleaning, it’s a useful practice.
Here are some suggestions from my side:

While your approach of code automatization is definitely very solid in general, and will be certainly useful for big projects and complicated and repetitive tasks, for the scope of exactly this project (having relatively small datasets and more or less simple tasks) it could have been less automated. Otherwise, it’s like creating a super-complicated algorithm for just cooking a porridge  For example, the function list_viewer can be omitted at all, since you can do the same task much easier with a mere Python. Also, it’s better to create functions only in case if you are going to repeat the same set of actions many times (well, at least 3).
A good practice is to define the functions not all at the beginning of the project, but when they have to be used. For example, you could define your rem_non_eng in the corresponding section, just before its first usage. By the way, it’s better not to cut words, especially verbs, in the name of the function: here remove_non_eng would be more explicit.
I would recommend you to re-phrase the introduction a bit. I mean, this hypothetical situation is not exactly true: that we work as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. It’s better to avoid this description and re-write it in a different way.
Please add a link to the dataset at the beginning of the project. I know, the dataset was modified afterwards by the DQ; yet the link at the original version is still necessary.
When the project is already finished, it’s recommended to re-run it, so that all the code cells are in order and start from 1.
Be careful to check the completed project for typos and correct them.
Please remove the last markdown cell (the empty one, right after the conclusion).

Overall, great and well-organized work, and super-professional code. Happy learning and good luck with your future projects!

Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL (SQL Skills Path),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql-sql-skills-path/549919,"
Hi Tomas,
Welcome to the Community and congratulations on finishing your first project! 
Here are some suggestions from me for your consideration:

Your code looks correct, and so it brings correct results. However, your project seems to lack the story behind it: project title, goals, intruduction, markdown comments analyzing and explaining the results after each code cell, conclusion summarizing the main results of the project. You might find these guidelines useful for this purpose, and also, probably, looking through other people’s guided projects on the same topic can give you some interesting ideas.
A good practice is to re-run an already completed project, to have all the code cells in order and start from 1.
In some code cells ([16], [32]) you can consider using ROUND.
The code cells [32], [51]: it’s enough to cast into float or only numerator, or only denominator, not necessarily both of them. This will make the code cleaner.
For the code cells [32], [45], [51] you can consider using LIMIT (showing only TOP10 or BOTTOM10, for example).
You might find helpful this SQL style guide, especially the section “Spaces” (so-called “rivers”).
Please remove the last empty code cell.

Hope my ideas were useful. Good luck with your future projects!
Happy learning!

Hi @Daniel_H
That’s a great project, congratulations!
To answer your question. After you find the best model you can apply the transform functions to new data, which obviously needs to have the same features as the model, and then you can write another function that predicts the new value using the entire dataset and predicting on the new values.
I’ll show you an example

This is a function (actually is just part of it) that i had to make to predict the air quality index of different cities using some weather variables. When that function is called it will show this

Guided Project: Answering Business Questions for Chinook Using SQL,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-answering-business-questions-for-chinook-using-sql/549757,"
Hi Sean,
Thanks for sharing your project. It looks awsome!  I liked many things there: very good and easy-to-follow storytelling and project structure, amazing visualizations (emphasizing the bars of interest was a good idea), adding comments not only to the python part of the code but also inside the queries themselves, writing separately main results and recommendations in the conclusion, good usage of bold font where necessary. Well done!
Here are some suggestions that I hope you’ll find useful:

When the project is completed, it’s better to re-run it, to have all the code cells in order and start with 1.
A good practice is to use a uniform style of quote marks (for the strings in the pieces of code) throughout the whole project: or only single, or only double quote marks.
For a long line of code with many arguments, like in the code cells [177] and [181], you can divide it into several lines for better readability (one argument for one row). For example, in case of the code cell [181], instead of:

ax.pie(x=protected['pct'], labels=protected['media_type'], colors=colors, autopct=""%1.1f%%"", textprops={'fontsize':15})

you can write:
ax.pie(
       x=protected['pct'], 
       labels=protected['media_type'], 
       colors=colors, 
       autopct=""%1.1f%%"", 
       textprops={'fontsize':15}
       )


The graphs from the code cells [177], [181]: it’s better to emphasize the “good” categories in both cases (individual tracks and non-protected media type, correspondingly) in green color, as you did with some other graphs.
The code cells [179] and [180]: here you can remove the top and right spines of the figure.
I would suggest you to put the list of business questions in the introduction rather than in the conclusion.

Once again, great job your project, congratulations! Happy learning and keep this high level!

There were moments when I forgot to use pandas and got stuck in loops and turning dictionaries into dataframes

Actually  working with pandas for the first time in a project like Exploring eBay car Sales isn’t easy at all . It was a nightmare for me  and every single moment I had to get back to the missions for refreshment .But with more interaction I had, pandas has become my best and most preferable tool to use in any analysis. I hope this will reflect the same when you will be working on your upcoming projects.

Hi @abd.shallal
Congratulations for having completed the project on  Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data. I like your presentation , it’s looks cool and well organized. Just have few suggestions;


In the introduction, I think it will be more better if you add little bit of explanation. And  also all your entire coding section lacks comments, which to me is very useful when handling any python projects. With the comments, it will be easier for the reader to engage with and even understand your codes lines.


Also by indicating the aim of the projects, it’s obvious that you have to reach at the conclusion( the findings), which is missing in your projects.so please hope you will fixed it up.


Otherwise, everything looks okay and just wishing a happy learning and a Happy New Year!.

Definitely the hardest so far and the one which took me the longest

Very true this one of the complicated projects ever interacted with. Having said that, have got few suggestions to make;

you have repeatedly imported numpy libraries that is in cell[24] and cell[34].if you check cell[1], the numpy libraries were imported and that was all no need again to import the libraries it’s a kind of repetition, take  note on that please.
The introduction is okay, but to me , I think adding a link to the datasets you have used is always important. I’ll will therefore encourage you to add the links of the datasets you will be using afterwards.
please check on cell [6],it’s not that clear more so the comment part. Just to mention na_values parameter helps you to read the not stated values as NaN.

Otherwise to me, everything looks good and am wishing you happy learning!

Your code looks good, and the obtained results are correct. However, your project seems to lack the story behind it: project title, project goals, intruductional part, markdown comments analyzing and explaining the results after each code cell, conclusion summarizing the main results of the project. You might find these guidelines useful for this purpose, and also, probably, looking through other people’s guided projects on the same topic can give you some interesting ideas.
Some more comments from my side:

When the project is already completed, it’s better to re-run it, in order to have all the code cells in order starting from 1.
Please remove the last empty code cell.
It’s better to round the average value in the code cell [16].
For writing SQL queries, or better to say for styling them according to the conventions, you can find this guide helpful.

I am looking forward to seeing basically any kind of feedback

Your project lacks a title, that is, what  the project is all about. Introducing a title to the project makes the reader to have a rough idea of what the project is all about.
It would be better to include the aim of your projects  ,what are these questions your are trying to answer…and by that, reaching onto a conclusion will be fairly easy.
Also do something on the history background of the dataset you are using, adding the links and so on. all this should be done in the introduction. This will guide you through.

 christoph.grabenstei
It wasn’t too much to code, so I feel quite confident about that, but I don’t have a lot experience in reading graphs and interpreting them.

I agree with you that reading and interpreting graphs require little bit of experience, but with  consistency put in place  all shall be well.
Otherwise everything to me looks good and please consider above as humble suggestions.

Hi @nathalia.pignaton,
Thank you for sharing your project, it looks very nice! Well-structured, the code well-commented and clean, storytelling coherent and easy to follow. Also, I like your usage of emphasizing around the project where necessary (using bold and italic-bold fonts). Well done!
Here are some suggestions from my side, hope they will be useful:

Chapter numbering: number 7 is missed.
The code cell [2]: it’s better to remove the second code (the commented-out one) from the project, but of course, to keep it in mind in future.
The code cell [3]. When we select only rows from a dataframe, we can omit the column part. I mean, we can write here recent_grads.iloc[:5], or, exactly in this case, even recent_grads.head().
It’s better to use a uniform quote marks style for string data throughout the project: or  only single, or only double ones.
For some graphs, especially in the chapter 4, I would write more markdown comments. Well, I agree with you that there isn’t much correlation among the columns here  But the absence of result is also a result.  Also, you can try to zoom some parts of graphs, it can happen that some correlation reveals itself only for small values of certain graphs, for example.
You should add a conclusion at the end, summarizing the most interesting and useful insights obtained while doing this project.
I would recommend you to return once again to this project after the mission called “Improving Plot Aesthetics” and do the following: increase the font of plot titles, plot labels, and legend labels, add titles where missing, remove grids (for example, for the plots in the chapter 4) and despine all the plots (remove at least top and right spines).

All in all, congratulations for the great job and good luck with your future projects as well!
Happy New Year!

I agree with you that the output( of the last code cell) is self explanatory, but I would suggest that you add just a little explanation  as this  shows the consistency of the objectives of your project.
Also this project ,can be written in just a single code cell hope you noticed that, but I can see you have followed the instructions as given which is still okay. With the single code cell could have saves you more space and time spent as well.

Hello @jesusayala893, thanks for sharing your work. The project looks amazing, it is very informative, neat presentation style, thorough explanation…



 jesusayala893:

One specific thing that I would like comments on is if you guys prefer tables or plots when summarizing my results.


A Picture is worth a thousand words. Adding plots to the analysis makes it easy to understand the insights and is self-explanatory.

Happy Learning!

Hi @AlaAlkhresheh
Welcome to the community and congratulations on finishing a guided project.
Your code looks good though I am not able to find any of the outputs.
Usually a guided project focuses on  creating a project report of our analysis, not just the code.
So we usually follow a guideline of having an introduction, explanations about our code, analysis and our conclusions. This article will help you as a guideline.
Also, have a look at previously submitted guided projects on Hacker News post to get a better idea.
Hope this helps. Happy learning.

Project 2. Hacker News. Ask for feedback,6,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-2-hacker-news-ask-for-feedback/549310,"
Hi @sergibtrader,
Thank you very much for sharing your hard work with DQ community.
First thing you have to keep in mind that Data scientists are not born they are made. The standard strategy to becoming a Data scientist is studying hard, dedication, reading books and taking online courses on all kinds of algorithms and techniques. But that is not enough to solve real issues. For that you need experience, and you can only get experience with time and work. As a newbie it is really hard to find a opportunity to work with real issues and get that experience. However, DQ does a great job to bridge this gap into some extend as these guided projects are giving you a very good opportunity to get the experience by working with real issues.
So don’t worry about mistakes and shortcomings that occur during the initial stage. However, the important thing is figuring out your mistakes and shortcomings and working on those issues.
Now lets look at your project. In general, I do not see a big issue in your project but still there are certain areas that you have to work on to improve your project. I would like to propose following improvements for your project.


Always start the project with brief but meaningful introduction about project and dataset that you are going to work with.


Maintain separate cell for importing libraries and modules for entire project. better to use the cell after the introductory section.


Simplicity and readability of the codes are very important. Python language has some programming guidelines outlined in PEP8 - for example consistent indentation, a specific line length, writing one statement per line only, and formulating pieces of code in a rather explicit than implicit way.


Better to add comments for each code block by explaining what does that specific code or code block do. This will help readers to understand your codes and logic behind the codes easily. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes.


Avoid very long titles and subtitles


Please refer to An In-Depth Style Guide for Data Science Projects to learn more about Data Science project formats.
I hope my feedback’s useful and will help with some more immediate improvements.
Happy coding.
Cheers

Guided Project: Simple SQL Usage to Explore the CIA World Factbook Database,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-simple-sql-usage-to-explore-the-cia-world-factbook-database/549421,"
Hi Ivan,
Thank you for sharing another good project! I see that now the navigation links work well, that’s a good news  How have you resolved it, by the way?
Your project is well-structured, the code follows SQL guidelines and that’s why looks very neat. This your insight:

It’s worth noting that India will add more than 15 million people as compared to China’s 6 million.

looks curious and quite unexpected, at least for me.
Now, I have some ideas for your consideration:


About the migration rate: yes, on the CIA website it should be “net migration rate”, i.e. immigrants - emigrants per 1000 persons. The second (and the last) kind of migration rate is “gross migration rate”, i.e. immigrants + emigrants per 1000 persons, which is, evidently, always positive or 0. Anyway, on the CIA website the migration rate is of the first type, but the values in the factbook version for this guided project are somewhat strange, I totally agree with you. There are no negative values that are definitely supposed to be: for example, for Syria or for other countries where in 2015 (the date of this factbook version) there was a war and an obvious flow of refugees and, of course, no immigrants. So yes, something strange happened with that column. In fact, when doing this project, I was also desperate to figure it out and just gave up to include the migration rate data in my analysis.


The code cell [9]: it would be good to use the aliases for the columns here, to improve their readability.


The code cells [6] and  [7] can be combined in one.


The code cell [8]: it’s better to exclude also Antarctica.


Even though it’s true that the cell outputs show the results of each query, I would add more markdown explanations all around the project on what these results really mean. For example, for the countries with higher death rate than birth rate it can be interesting to investigate what exactly happened there that led to such circumstances. I was very surprised to see among those countries (and even at the top places!) Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Baltic countries. Some inquiries on these countries and their current situation would be interesting: if there was a particularly strong economical or demographical crisis, if some government programs were applied to resolve the problem, if the situation is improved now, 5 years later, etc.


As for water-land ratio, apart  from British Indian Ocean Territory, there are some other “ill” data in the dataset, and unfortunately they are exactly one of the “leaders” in the TOP-list. To better understand what is supposed to be a “country water” and what issues it can bring to your data analysis, you can refer to these links:

CIA Factbook issues
Water area definition and examples
Territorial waters
Coastal waters



Once again about the water-land sections: probably you should put them after all the demographic sections, for not mixing them up.


It’s better to extend the conclusion and add the most interesting geographical / demographical insights that were obtained while doing this project. Also, I would add something about it in the introduction as well, as a goal of the project: we are going to explore demographical / geographical tendencies…, etc, something like that.


I hope my suggestions were helpful for this your project and for the future ones. Happy learning and interesting insights!

My Fourth Guided Project: Visualizing Earning Based On College Majors,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-fourth-guided-project-visualizing-earning-based-on-college-majors/549462,"
Hi @nathalia.pignaton
Good to see yet another project from you. I’m pretty sure that it must be a bit confusing to switch from one library to another. I don’t know why you didn’t use .head() and used .iloc instead in cell#3 while you used tail() in the very next cell. Anyway both did their job properly.
One suggestion is that, at the bottom of each plot, you could have added a brief observation.
For the histogram, since some of them are very skewed, we can set the limits and zoom in to find some relationships.
When it reached bar graphs, you skipped adding their x and y labels along with their titles.
For the grouped bar graph, if you wish you can also try the horizontal bar graph version, so that it might be easier to read the subject names and compare them easily.
Also, a separate section and heading for conclusion would have been better.
Anyway, these are just some of my suggestions. You have done a good job with this project as well. Keep up the good work.

Guided Project (201): Star Wars Survey,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-201-star-wars-survey/549026,"
Hi Ivan,
Thank you for sharing your project with the Community!
Your data analysis is very thorough and profound, the code is clean and well-commented. Also, it was a great approach to combine both header rows into one and introduce the necessary substitutions in the resulting column names. Another interesting idea was to find all the odds in the dataset and put them in the appendix, these things look really curious for further consideration and fixing!
Here are some suggestions from my side, which hopefully will be helpful to you:

The navigation links, while being in general a good idea to add in the project, don’t open (at least in GitHub). This should be fixed.
It’s better to use the bold font pointedly, only for emphasizing some important details in the project.
It’s recommended to re-run the whole project when it’s already completed, to have all the code cells in order and starting from 1.
A good practice is to use “we” instead of “I” throughout the project (as I read in some guidelines and then saw in many projects).
Visualizations. It’s better to add a title to each plot (and make its font big enough for better readability), despine the pots, and for some of them change labels to something shorter (or alternatively, consider horizontal bar plots for such cases).
Please add a conclusion section, better before the appendix.
The code cells [75] and [83]: here probably some automation can be applied, using a for-loop.
The code cells [76] and [79]: better to check here only the just converted columns.
The code cells [89]-[93]. In this part of the project, I would emphasize that the rating 1 is actually the best one, while 6 - the worst. Otherwise mentioning “negative correlation” between the rating and the number of viewers looks scaring and confusing 

The code cell [96].  In this way, you’re losing the categories of people between 30 and 60 y.o. (also for the further analysis), as well as people with the income between 25 and 150k. They represent quite big middle categories, which should be kept and, probably, even further subdivided for subsequent data analysis.
Just a curiosity, what “201” means in the project title? Is it the year of the survey occasionally truncated?

That’s all about my observations. In general, your project looks very nice and solid, and the insights are interesting and sometimes even unexpected.
Good luck with your further projects and happy holidays!

In the introduction you haven’t provided the links of the dataset you are using, though not saying it’s must to add the link but it’s advisable to do so.
you have hardly used the comments, and instead presented them in the markdown cell, bringing me to my second point; Always try  to avoid stating obvious things in markdown cells or comments, like about importing libraries, printing the first rows with head().

Hi @balaorcl
You have done a great work on the ebay dataset. Everything looks very systematic and neat.
I think all I have is a suggestion regarding the price outlier and that too at the lower end. So in the instructions it was given that $1 can be accepted since auctions can be started from $1 on ebay. But one of the co-learners here also found out by doing internet search, that some people are selling their cars for free on German ebay! If these things are true and we decide to take into consideration, we will have to accept the 0 and 1 in our prices.
What do you think about it?
Another humble suggestion is that, it would have been better if you could have a slightly more elaborated conclusion section and an introduction section with download links to dataset.
Otherwise you have done a nice job with this analysis.

Hi @ksenia.kustanovich,
This is just brilliant! You’ve set the bar so high for anyone who is going to attempt this project in the future (which includes me too  )
I am currently working on this project and taking up a lot of time learning more about plotting. After seeing your project, I realised that I am just scratching the surface of data visualisation. I’m not even getting into plotly or getting the hover effect, but still I’m struggling to execute my ideas!
Your project is indeed a great inspiration. I have thoroughly enjoyed how you’ve cleaned the data and took care of the missing values.You made it all look so effortless! I think the best part I enjoyed would be the sun burst plot. I was trying too hard to create a similar concept but with just gender categories and it has been a struggle. I still haven’t completely figured out yet. But you have simply plotted a wonderful chart with this creative sun burst plot! I’ll probably bookmark your project for now and will come back later when I want to redo the project.
Thanks a lot for inspiring with this awesome project.

Hi @Selkrin,
It is good to see your first project as well. Good to see you finished 2 projects and posted it here.
One suggestion like I mentioned in the other one, is to have a separate section for introduction and conclusion with a heading for a better reading project report.



 Selkrin:

I did have some extra stuff not related to the project in there, just examples for myself.


I think the extra stuff you mentioned were in cell number 17 and 35. It is good that you are trying out things and experimenting with it. But personally I am not sure if it should be part of this report.
Also, it would be a good idea to restart and run all the cells in jupyter notebook before publishing. Then all the cells will be in order and it will be more like a last check for any errors before submitting.
In case you want to limit the number of items while printing in the below code


# Breakdown of ""BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE"" apps
for app in android_final:
    if app[1] == ""BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE"":
        print(app[0], "":"", app[5])


You can use a counter like i=0 and increment it and set a condition to exit the loop when i reaches 25 or something like that.
I hope these suggestions are useful to you. Happy learning. Looking forward to your upcoming projects.

Hi @Selkrin,
Congratulations on finishing this project. I quite like how you have incorporated some of the learning from the first guided project here.
Here is a few pointers that might be helpful to you.

You are using print("""") to create an empty line. You can also use \n at the end of a line to add a new line, for example print(""First line \n \n Second line"") and it will print


first line
second line


Another place where you can apply some shortcut is this

total_ask_comments = total_ask_comments + int(num_comments)

When you have to do an operation on the same variable and update it, you can use
 i += 1 instead of i = i + 1
If the above two suggestions were used intentionally for better readability, please don’t mind my suggestions.
It would be better to have an slightly elaborated introduction, which also mentioning a bit about the data sets, where to download them etc.
Altogether your project looks good. I hope this helps. Happy learning.

Guided Project: Car Price prediction with k-nearest neighbors algorithm,18,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-car-price-prediction-with-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm/548658,"
Hi @WilfriedF,
Great job on the project! I love it that you explored outside of the curriculum. I’ve learned quite a few new concepts reading your project. Special thanks for the resources on elbow detection. 
I also admire the diligence you put in the code and style of the project. I don’t know if you know this already or not, since you are using docstrings for all your functions, further down the course, there’s actually a session for best practices and specifically how to format the docstrings by Google style.
While learning about MAPE, I came across this article that might help in understanding why the MAPE score didn’t behave as expected from the RMSE score.  Quote from the article in the link by Agrima Bahl:

MAPE puts a larger penalty on negative errors . What this means is that for the same error, the error is higher when aᵗ < fᵗ than when aᵗ > fᵗ. 
For example, for the actual value 100 and estimated value of 90, the MAPE is 0.10. For the same estimated value and actual value of 80, the MAPE is 0.125. Therefore when using MAPE as an objective function, the estimator prefers smaller values and can be biased towards negative errors.

I like the Pravlence of binary features plot, it’s very informative. It also brought another point I didn’t consider either when doing this project. When hot encoding categorical features, there is one thing to keep in mind, the redundant information from the nature of the binary features. For instance, we have a binary gender feature, when hot encoding it, it’s going to be female, with ones and zeros, and male, with ones and zeros. But these two columns have essentially the same information. This could lead to a problem of overfitting. So in these cases, we should probably drop one of them. Here’s what’s in the sklearn doc on this matter:

drop {‘first’, ‘if_binary’} or a array-like of shape (n_features,), default=None 
Specifies a methodology to use to drop one of the categories per feature. This is useful in situations where perfectly collinear features cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data into a neural network or an unregularized regression.
However, dropping one category breaks the symmetry of the original representation and can therefore induce a bias in downstream models, for instance for penalized linear classification or regression models.

Thanks for sharing your awesome project! I really learned a lot from it.

Hi @joshi.ananya.joshi1, congratulations for having completed the guided project. With look of things you have followed the guidelines as provided which is okay.
considering this;

 joshi.ananya.joshi1
Are the insights made from my end accurate?

The answer is yes, only that  you could have explained further. Imagine  somebody who is meeting correlation for the first and he /she encounter this;


So, based on the scatterplot and bar plot above we can say that there is almost no correlation among the ‘ap_per’ and ‘sat_score’. Even if we consider this as a correlation the it’s not to be considered as a strong correlation.

To be honest the guy wouldn’t get anything so it’s advisable to give further clarification. For example a positive correlation may be between the AP scores and SAT scores means that if you score high in the AP test then you will have the same in SAT result that is haver a high score.
Hope this was helpful, happy learning.

avg_by_hour = []

# Populating our list with the values of posts per hour
for item in counts_by_hour:
    information = list([item, round(int(comments_by_hour[item])/int(counts_by_hour[item]),2)])

Re-sharing guided project Exploring eBay Car Sales Data: feedback welcome,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/re-sharing-guided-project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-feedback-welcome/481309,"
Hello,
I’m currently checking your project out as I’m writing this. The points I’d like to state are:

If you upload this project to your github etc. as a folder you downloaded from Dataquest containing the .csv file and the notebook, I’d highly recommend that instead of linking the second dataset to Dataquest, saying that the dataset is in the repository. Because not everyone might have access to that Dataquest mission page, i.e non-Dataquest people.
I like how you’re excited about this project in the markdowns! I also like the fact that you’re commenting the code. Commenting is a really good habit!
I’d recommend using autos.head() instead of printing the entire dataset in the second cell. And since you’ve used that in the cell below, you can omit the second cell.
In the 5th cell, I see that you’ve replaced the column names one-by-one in the function you defined. Instead of that, I’d recommend you use the map() function.
“In a way it could be tempting to throw away the rows with a price of 0, considering it ‘incorrect data’. But then, is a price of 1 more realistic? Or a price of 29, 65 or 123? It is hard to set a particular limit for this, and consider everything below that ‘outliers’ or ‘incorrect’. And maybe people do just want to get rid of their old worn-out cars? Available for who still sees some value in it - maybe just for spare parts - and wants to put the effort to collect the cars.” is an interesting approach. However, spamming in these kinds of websites considered, I’d still recommend you put a lower limit for the price column. If you don’t do that, summary statistics calculations like the mean price etc. might come out very wrong and unrepresentative of the actual data.
The beginning of the markdown below the 29th cell “Nothing looking particularly suspect there actually.” should be changed to “Nothing looking particularly suspicious* there actually.”.

Don’t be discouraged although I’ve made so many recommendations, that’s because I looked into your project in great care. Overall, great work! Keep the good work up and keep sharing with us! 
Best,

hi @anfany623,congratulations for having completing your project on analyzing profitable app profiles for the app store and google play markets. Have gone through  your project and have the following to point out;

the title of your project is not that well synthesize, since you are working as data analysts, I think by saying this Types of apps that attract more users isn’t enough.
it’s advisable to give history background and the links of the dataset you are using which should be included in the introduction. so recheck on your introduction.
you have hardly presented the observations of the outputs, check on this as well.

having saying that mine is to wish a happy learning!

Congratulations @wolewani for having completing the project on Exploring hacker news Posts.
I have gone through it and have the following to point out;

you need to add more weight on introduction, that is make sure to include history background of the dataset you are using and if possible provide the link.
You should always bold some of the points you feel is so important, though this isn’t a must but I feel it will increase the readability. You can use this for more clarification.

Otherwise the project is well presented and am wishing a happy learning!

Analyzing CIA Factbook Data using SQL - C.O,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql-c-o/548696,"
Hi @carologira8, congratulations for having completing  the project. I have gone through it and have got the following to point out;

most of your  outputs are  one based solution, for example ,finding countries with high population, it is better to  work with the average values


Have a look

%%sql
SELECT name AS Country, 
        population,
        population_growth
    FROM facts
    where (population > 62352583.6265560) & (name <> ""World"")
    ORDER BY population DESC
    limit 5


sqlite:///factbook.db
Done.

Country	                       population	population_growth
China	                      1367485388	    0.45
India	                      1251695584	    1.22
European Union	              513949445	        0.25
United States	              321368864	        0.78
Indonesia	                  255993674	        0.92


This give the top five countries with the highest population, rather than printing out only one country china as in your case.

your projects also lacks data background history ,which is very important when working on any given project. The introduction part is also not well synthesize, you need to add the goal/aim.
Recheck your conclusion it’s not that well presented. In the conclusion , always remember  to present out the findings.

"Review for Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys, anyone?",5,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-for-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys-anyone/547432,"
Hi @jithins123,
That’s great, congratulations on finishing another challenging project! I agree that they are becoming more and more difficult throughout the course. It’s actually very good, because it requires you to really search for the right answer, for the best approach, and activate all your resources (I saw somewhere another kind of “guided projects”, where everything is already written for you, and you have only to fill some rare gaps). But sometimes you can feel stuck for many days, or even can go in a wrong direction with the analysis, that’s also true.
Well, now some suggestions about your project.

I would definitely recommend, when you return back to this project, to analyze the dissatisfaction by age and to make also comparison between DETE and TAFE separately. I remember that in the previous version of your project you started analyzing the age factor. Now that you removed (finally ) all the redundant columns, such analysis will be much more clear and informative. The same about the comparison DETE vs. TAFE. Personally, I found some interesting insights when doing this comparison (let’s say, the distributions for them are quite different, which looks curious), as well as analyzing the factor of age.
It’s better to add more customizing to visualizations. Well, for the same project my visualizations are not the best example, and I’ll definitely return to improve them. Anyway, in this case I would increase the figure size, the title and labels font, add a name to the y-axis, remove the one of the x-axis (the name of categories are sufficient here), remove top and right spines together with the ticks, remove the legend, which is redundant here.
There seems to be an issue with the links at the beginning of the project (I just mean the way how they are visualized).
The code cell [35]. Here it would be better to use value_counts(), maybe with sorting. This would improve the readability of the output.
I would also recommend you to use a uniform style of quote marks throughout the project (or always single, or always double). It’s not crucial, of course, but is a good practice.

Well, nothing else to add from my side. For the rest great job, clean and well-commented code, exhaustive markdown explanations. In the code cell [27] I found out how to select non-successional columns all together 
Congratulations also on becoming tier-2 Learning Assistant!

My Guided Project (eBay Car Sales),3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-guided-project-ebay-car-sales/548338,"
Hi @zainab_ali_alamer,
Great job your project! It looks very well-structured and well-commented, the introduction and conclusion are enough detailed, informative and to the point. Good idea to put the studied resources at the end of the project. Also, I liked that you checked the dataset on the presence of duplicated rows.
Here are some suggestions from my side:

When mentioning pieces of codes, functions, methods, or column names in markdown, it’s better to include them in backticks (`). For example, nr_of_pictures instead of nr_of_pictures. It will give them more emphasis and facilitate reading.
About the range of car prices, probably you should search some more information on the Internet. When I was doing this project, I found a couple of forums, unfortunately in Russian, where people were discussing exactly those cars with 0 price on German eBay. And it seems that they really exist, the cars that are just given free, because of some particular reasons, of course. Actually, the cars with the price of 1$ don’t look less scaring either  The same thing about the upper limit, probably it should be increased (it’s possible that some “retro” cars have a very high price). But of course, all these 0-priced cars and those extremely expensive represent a very small percent of all the data, so just dropping them can be a reasonable approach.
Instead of dropping separately minimum and maximum outlier ranges, you can first define your ultimate minimum and maximum limits and then use between() method to cut off all the values outside this range (re-assigning the result back to your main dataframe).
The registration_year range. Here the lower limit can be increased. Even though the first cars appeared in 1885, it is really very low probable that those first cars are represented in this dataset  Also, looking at the rows (which are very few) earlier than 1910, we can see that the predominant majority of columns for these entries have missing values. So dropping these rows seems a good idea.
The code cell [49]. In this way, you are not really substituting these values with NaN. Instead, you should use np.nan:

import numpy as np
autos.loc[autos['registration_month'] == 0,'registration_month'] = np.nan
autos['registration_month'].value_counts(normalize = True, dropna=False)


The markdown cells after the code cells [5], [11] and [20]: it would be good to use here markdown bullet lists for more emphasis.
For the sake of consistency, it’s better to make all the subheadings in title style (each word starting with a capital letter).
The code cells [27] and [36]. I would remove the comments describing technical details about how those functions and attributes work.
The round() function can be applied to brand_by_mile.

Hope my suggestions were helpful.
Once again, congratulations on doing a great project!

Guided Project2: Exploring Hacker News Posts,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project2-exploring-hacker-news-posts/546715,"
Hi @jmerrell247,
Thanks for sharing your project! It looks good, with a clean code, exhaustive markdown explanations, and especially I like that the code is clearly and precisely commented where necessary.
Below are my ideas, hopefully useful, for your consideration:

It’s better to be consistent throughout the project and use or “I”, or “we” (in any case, avoiding using passive voice). The best practice is to use “we”.
I would not recommend you to use too much italic font (as well as bold), only to emphasize some important short phrases or words.
The subheadings should be bigger (but smaller than the title font, of course).
It’s better to put a link on the dataset source in the introductional part of the project.
To avoid confusion in the code cell numbers, a good practice is to re-run an already completed project.
The code cell [10]. It would be good to print which number refers to which list, just as you did in [97]. By the way, in this case you can remove the corresponding markdown explanation below it.
The code cell [97] The markdown explanation right after is a bit confusing and, probably, should be rephrased it in a more clear way.
You should specify the time zone for which you defined this time. You can find it in the documentation for the dataset, but I can also tell you in advance :  it’s Eastern Time in the US. Also, you can convert the resultant time into the time in your own country.
The last empty cell should be removed.

Good job having done this project! And good luck with your further ones!

Hi @ahadov.rufat,
Your project is very good, and I liked it much more than my own one on the same topic!  The code is really dynamic and efficient, and the project itself is very well-organized. Also, good idea to make conclusions by category. Well done!
Here are some suggestions from me, hopefully they will be useful:

Probably the second paragraph in the introduction is a little bit too descriptive and can be dropped, or at least moved from the introduction to the markdown cell before the final code cell.
It’s better to re-run the already finished project to keep all the code cells in order.
The code cells are very well-commented, which is perfect. The only thing, you can probably add some space (even tabulation) between the code lines and their lateral comments, otherwise sometimes they are difficult to read.
The final code cell. It’s better to increase the font for the image title. Also, the red color for the subtitles visually mixes with the orange color of the plots and doesn’t bring additional information to the image. Better to change it with black.
The notes after the final code cell look a bit too detailed (your graph is already quite self-explanatory) and could be reduced. But the last observation is very good and really not so clear in case of agriculture (at least for me ).

All in all, great job! Congratulations and happy learning!

HI @reza_45, congratulations for having completed  the  guided project I have gone through your work and  everything is well detailed. I have been impressed  on how you have organized your work with the  help of table of content.
Having said that, have got few suggestions;

your introduction is not that well digested. It would be better to add the goal or the aim of the project, and give some information on the data background .
Your project is also missing conclusion, which is very important when working on any project.
And when  you apply groupby () function on a dataframe ,reset the given column back to the column using reset_index() on that dataframe, otherwise  that column will  be treated as an index and not  as a column again. This is one of your code with groupby function


# aggregate prices by unrrepaired_damage to find mean price
dudap =autos[['unrepaired_damage', 'price']].groupby(by=['unrepaired_damage']).mean()
print(dudap)
# print the result
print('The un_repaired damaged cars are {:.0%} cheaper.'.format(1 - dudap.loc['yes','price']/dudap.loc['no','price']))

output
                         price
unrepaired_damage             
yes                2207.283669
no                 6479.250803
The un_repaired damaged cars are 66% cheaper.

You can confirm that unrepaired_damage is now considered as an index, to avoid this use
reset_index()  on your dataframe like this dudap .reset_index()

Feedback about Winning Jeopardy,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-about-winning-jeopardy/518140,"
Hi Nasim, nice project. I also had your second question, but I believe you have the right interpretation of the results. I used the entire Jeopardy dataset and found that the low_value_count was over 2x larger than the high_value_count. The p-value tells us if the observed value is significantly different than the expected value, which in this case appears to be true since the expected value for low_value would be over 2x larger than the expected value for high_value. Hence, even words that have similar frequency in high_value and low_value questions could be interesting to study because most words should have a distribution skewed towards low_value questions. Hope that is helpful, and let me know if you agree 
Best regards,
Colton

Congratulations @shipWship for completing your second project. honestly , your project is well detailed and clear. I really love it the way you have presented out the codes and the comments, very smooth and easy to follow.
Having saying that, I have got one suggestion.

you could have avoided the print() function  when displaying some of the codes.

Have a look at this
import datetime as dt

result_list = []
counts_by_hour = {}    # The number of ask_posts created every hour
comments_by_hour = {}  # The number of comments obtained by the ask_posts 

for row in ask_posts:
    created_at = row[-1]
    num_comments = int(row[4])
    result_list.append([created_at, num_comments])
    
for result in result_list:
    comments_result = result[1]
    creation_time_str = result[0]
    creation_time_dt = dt.datetime.strptime(creation_time_str, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M')
    creation_hour = creation_time_dt.strftime('%H')

    if not creation_hour in counts_by_hour:
        counts_by_hour[creation_hour] = 1
        comments_by_hour[creation_hour] = comments_result
    else:
        counts_by_hour[creation_hour] += 1
        comments_by_hour[creation_hour] += comments_result
print(counts_by_hour)

with the print()function applied in counts_by_hour , the output were displayed horizontally like this
{'09': 45, '13': 85, '10': 59, '14': 107, '16': 108, '23': 68, '12': 73, '17': 100, '15': 116, '21': 109, '20': 80, '02': 58, '18': 109, '03': 54, '05': 46, '19': 110, '01': 60, '22': 71, '08': 48, '04': 47, '00': 55, '06': 44, '07': 34, '11': 58}

which to me is less readable.
To obtain  output displayed vertically, just  call out your dictionary counts_by_hour without the print() function 
Have a look
counts_by_hour

output
{'09': 45, 
 '13': 85, 
 '10': 59,
 '14': 107,
 '16': 108, 
 '23': 68, 
 '12': 73, 
 '17': 100, 
 '15': 116, 
 '21': 109, 
 '20': 80, 
 '02': 58, 
 '18': 109,  
 '03': 54,  
 '05': 46, 
 '19': 110,
 '01': 60, 
 '22': 71,  
 '08': 48, 
 '04': 47, 
 '00': 55,

Guided SQL project (CIA factbook),1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-sql-project-cia-factbook/539587,"
Hi @martin16 ,
Thanks for sharing your project!
Here are some suggestions from my side, hope they will be useful to you:

You should add a title to your project, introduction (outlining your goals for the project and some background information about the data and the problem behind), and conclusion (summarizing the main results). As for the internal structure of the project, there should be different sections with the corresponding descriptive subheadings. Also, the  intermediate results throughout the project should be explained in the markdown cells. The best practice is to add a markdown explanation after each code cell.
When the project is already finished, it’s better to re-run it from the beginning. In this way, the code cells will start from 1 and will be all in order, so it will be easier to follow them and to refer when necessary.
The best practice is to follow the SQL conventions and use capital letters for writing statements, keywords and functions.
The last cell seems to be a draft and should be removed.
One code cell is repeated 3 times around the project:

%%sql
select * from facts
limit 5;

I would leave only one  of them, at the beginning of the project.

And yes, I agree with you, it was strange also to me to see the results of the birth and death rates difference 


I hope  my suggestions were helpful. Also, I’d recommend you for your future projects to get acquainted with these very useful and comprehensive guidelines.
Happy learning!

GUIDED PROJECT:Analyzing CIA World Factbook,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-analyzing-cia-world-factbook/547613,"
Hi @brayanopiyo18,
Congratulations on finishing your project!
Here are some suggestions from me, which I hope will be helpful:

The markdown explanations of the intermediate results, as well as the introductional part and the conclusion, could be more verbose about the features observed, while avoiding some technical details (like those at the beginning, about connecting to the database or about using LIMIT).
It’s better to exclude also Antarctica from the summary statistics, as well as the row for the whole world. Well, ideally you should exclude also the row for European Union that is present in the table.
I would recommend you to use ROUND with the summary statistics to avoid all those decimals.
Be careful not to make typos, especially in the subheadings.
Please delete the last empty code cell.
Finally, I would suggest you to  expand your data analysis. For this purpose, you can use the suggestions from the last screen of the DQ mission. For example, exploring the area, area_land, area_water, and their relationships is a good idea: finding the biggest and the smallest countries, those  biggest/smallest in terms of the proportion of the inner waters, those with 0 area_water, etc.

I hope my ideas were useful. Happy coding!

Analysing CIA Factbook Data In SQL,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analysing-cia-factbook-data-in-sql/548220,"
Hi @adbandy,
Thank you for sharing your project and welcome to the Community! 
Answering your question about the last lines: since the migration_rate is in % here, you just need to divide the product of population and migration_rate by 100. Then you will have 9.62 mln, not bln people. By the way, in that code cell (and in some others around your project, for example in [20], [123]-[125]) there is no need to use CAST, since it’s a multiplication here, not a division.
Below are some other comments from my side about your project:

It’s a good practice to re-run the project when it’s already finished. Then you will have all the code cells starting from 1 and all in order, without “jumps”.
It’s important to maintain a clear structure of the project: to have an introduction, a conclusion, enough markdown cells explaining the intermediate results (ideally, after each code cell there should be a markdown explanation of its results), project sections with proper subheadings.
About this your observation:


Interestingly seems to be no negative growths on the factbook, this seems unlikely.

Well, totally agree, I was surprised about it as well 

The code cell [60]. I’m just curious how the numbers in the WHERE condition were estimated. Probably, you should add some markdown comments on them.
The code cell [123] and some subsequent ones. Remember that birth_rate and death_rate are actually not in % (like it was with migration_rate) but in “number of births per 1,000 persons” and “number of deaths per 1,000 persons” correspondingly. So you cannot just multiply their difference by population. If you want to find a so-called natural increase here, you should just find the difference birth_rate - death_rate. This value will be exactly a “natural increase per 1,000 persons” (or a natural decrease, if negative).

For the rest, good job and nice project.
Hope my feedback was helpful. Happy learning!

You code is vertically spaced which improves the readability

What can be improved:

You subheadings are very technical and often state obvious things. You can collapse them in more general subheadings and make them a bit more attractive. Like, Removing Headers from a List of List is very technical and says almost nothing (you may collapse the first subheadings in just one, called, for instance, “Data Preparation”)
You have very long lists of posts by hour. Do you believe they are useful?
Not all code cells are commented (you do not have to exaggerate but in some cases, it’s useful to comment more than less)
Would you comment on the extra results? And leave a conclusion?

And a small suggestion: you can use the setdefault dictionary method to avoid if..else statements when building frequency tables.
Happy coding

Hello @wolewani, thank you for sharing your project. The project looks amazing, and I hope you’ve learned a lot in doing it. Here are my thoughts based on what you wanted to hear:

Markdown usage: As a beginner, you’ve written the markdown very well. Also, you can check on the following:


emphasis: words or sentences that have emphasis you can bold them or write in italics to catch the readers eyes.
In the markdown, codes should be in backtricks: check out this from your project


Your Code
After reading both datasets above, explore_data() function that take data_set, start,end,row_and_column as input parameters was created.


More Improved version
After reading both datasets above, explore_data() function that take data_set, start,end,row_and_column as input parameters was created.


Style of coding is amazing, also the names of your variables are reasonable hence providing more readability to your code.
The title of the project is attractive. In the conclusion, you can also include some of the findings you got when analyzing the dataset.

Guided Project for Feedback : Hacker News,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-for-feedback-hacker-news/548059,"
Hello @ninasweeney18! Thanks for sharing your project:) and congratulations on sharing your first project, it a great step in your journey.
Here is some feedback…
What I liked:

Your narratives are clear and well-presented
You code is space vertically which improves the readability
You title is clear and evokes positive emotions: oh, I want to maximize positive community engagement

What can be improved:

Add comments to the code, sometimes it’s not clear what you’re doing and trying to achieve. It will help everyone who reads your code, including you in the first place
To avoid if..else statements when building a frequency table (you count something - comments or points) you can use the setdefault dictionary method
Write a quick summary of your results in the beginning: when do we need to post?

Bold the most important information (like when we should post)

For the Other category you can try to play with regular expressions to analyze, for example, differences between posts mentioning different programming languages: SQL, Python, R and so on.
That all for me:)
Happy coding

Hi @shipWship,
You have done a great first project!! The details provided in the markdown cells are amazing. I felt like getting a better picture of this whole project. I haven’t seen any better ‘Profitable app’ project on DQ guided project till date than yours!  The overall flow is really good, the structure and sub headings are great.
Probably my only suggestion would be regarding printing the app names in certain category, especially the one in ‘family’
Since you decided to print all the names of the apps in family category, it almost felt like a never ending scrolling to get to the end of the list. Instead of printing all the values, you could have used a loop, counter and if condition to print only a limited number of items.
Other than that I don’t hany anything else to add. Great job. Looking forward to seeing more great projects from you. Happy learning.

Review for Analyzing NYC High School Data Needed,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-for-analyzing-nyc-high-school-data-needed/547671,"
Hi @jithins123
Disclaimer: I tend to focus only on code, coding style and visual output when reviewing guided projects. This being said, I think your overall code is easy to read and to comprehend. Great that you make use of code comments as well. The overall structure is good.
Some concrete feedback on your project.


Code comments: Having a blank line between a comment and a code line is rather unusual. More to the point, try not to desribe the process you employ in your comments (this is already apparent from the code itself), but what the purpose is and maybe why you have chosen this solution (especially if others have failed).


In know that you followed DQ instructions here, but it is still not ideal to not take care of column names in a consistent fashion. Having names with different capitalizations, with trailing whitespaces or with a combination of whitespaces and underscores will cause severe headachs sooner rather than later. You always need to keep track of the column style mentally. Try to find a consistent approach here across all data sets. I tend to work with no capitalization, no trailing whitespaces and underscores (for multi-word column names). A simple helper function can go a long way.


def standardize_col_names(df):
""""""Standardize formatting of dataframe colums""""""
    df.columns = (df.columns.str.strip()
                            .str.replace(' ', '_')
                            .str.lower())

    return df


Cell 6, applying zfill(): This is also part of the instructions, but again not ideal. If there are vectorized Pandas methods (str.zfill() in this case), it doesn’t make sense to write a function yourself and map it to the individual cells. Built-in, vectorized methods are allways preferable (more concise and faster). You could instead do something along the lines of

data['class_size']['padded_csd'] = (data['class_size']['csd'].astype('str')
                                                             .str.zfill(2))



Cell 9, adding columns. For 3 columns it is arguably possible to add them via the + operator. However, using sum() leads to more concise code in my eyes. Note: Be careful here, because depending on the Pandas version sum() handles missings in the cells it sums up differently. In Pandas 1.1.1 you do need to write data['sat_results'][cols].sum(axis=1, min_count=3) for this particular scenario. See the documentation for details.


Cell 11, again the issue with mapping functions instead of using Pandas vectorized methods (also in cell 29). Alternative code using str.extract() for this problem.


data['hs_directory']['lat'] = (data['hs_directory']['location_1']
                               .str.extract(r'(\d{2}\.\d*)')
                               .astype('float'))

data['hs_directory']['lon'] = (data['hs_directory']['location_1']
                               .str.extract(r'(-\d{2}\.\d*)')
                               .astype('float'))



The use of the argument inplace=True is discouraged and there is a debate about depracating it API wide. Just reassign the output. For further details: StackOverflow


Plots: Good use of seaborn! But please import all libraries in the first notebook cell and not somewhere in the middle. I also would highly encourage you to format all axis and columns labels properly. Based on my experience, people, who are not directly involved with coding, tend to be annoyed by plots just using variable names. Regarding the use of color (as said somewhere else): In most scenarios I would recommend avoiding double-coding of variables. In your barplots the x/y-value is also used for color (hue). Here, you are in essence adding an additional dimension (level of complexity) without increasing the information presented. Yes, it does look nice on the first glance, but it is not considered a good practice in data visualization. Better to avoid it.


I hope this list gives you some inspiration for revision. Let me know if you have further questions.
Best regards

Exploratory Visualization of the Gender Gap In College Degrees,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/exploratory-visualization-of-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/547929,"
Hi @shirurajagiri,
Congratulations on sharing your first guided project here. This project looks great.
Though I was thinking that the introduction could have been a bit more detailed. Also, the aim is not just limited to STEM fields alone as we are analysing other subjects as well.
You have used some smart logic to create this plot.
# remove all the spines

for key, spine in ax.spines.items():
    spine.set_visible(False)

Instead of this you can also use
for spine in ax.spines.values():
    spine.set_visible(False)

Also, the below code
# Remove the tick marks and labels for all plots
# Retain the tick label only for the last plot of each category
ax.tick_params(bottom='off', top='off', left='off', right='off', labelbottom='off')
if (int(sp/3)+1 == len(stem_cats)) or (int(sp/3)+1 == len(lib_arts_cats)) or (int(sp/3)+1 == len(other_cats)):
    ax.tick_params(labelbottom='on')

The logic becomes True for sp=13 and 15 as well which you don’t want. That is why you are getting an additional bottom labels on the penultimate plots in STEM and Other categories.
Maybe you need to have a second look at the if condition.
Other than that everything looks great. The conclusion part is also done nicely. Altogether a great work.
I hope this review was useful. Happy learning.

GP: Cleaning and Analysis of Employee Exit surveys,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-cleaning-and-analysis-of-employee-exit-surveys/528446,"
Hello @jesmaxavier, You’ve done an amazing job in your project.
I really like how you’ve documented your work by providing explanations to your findings.

Here are some things you can refactor


Your Function Code
# Function name: print_full(a_list)
# Input: A python list
# Output: The full list
# Description: Jupyter notebooks by default do not display all the data for large datasets. It shows a few lines and summarizes
# the rest using ellipsis. This function helps to see the full python list

def print_full(a_list):
    pd.set_option('display.max_rows', len(a_list))
    print(a_list)
    pd.reset_option('display.max_rows')



It would be great if you could make the comments in the above function be the function docstring. You can check the Docstring Convention.




DataCamp Community – 10 Apr 20



(Tutorial) Docstrings in Python
Learn about the different types of docstrings and various docstring formats like Sphinx, Numpy and Pydoc.






For me I prefer the Numpy’s docstring style.



Your series output code
print_full(combined_updated[""age""])



The above prints the entire series. It would be great if you print a portion of the series items, may be like the first 10 rows … You can use Series.head




Warnings from your code
C:\Users\maxen.x\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\core\generic.py:6287: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame

See the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy
  self._update_inplace(new_data)



Remember to filter the warnings generated by the code.The main warning encountered in your code is SettingWithCopyWarning, Read this from DataQuest Direct:





Equals (=) vs shallow copy vs deep copy in Pandas Dataframes Dataquest Direct


[adam-niescioruk-e7dVRT4tL9A-unsplash] 
In this article, I’m going to show you 3 ways of copying Dataframes in Pandas, explain how they are all different and tell you when you should use either. 
Equals (df1 = df)
When we assign a DataFrame to a new variable using =, we are not creating a new copy of the DataFrame. We are merely adding a new name to call the same object. The below example will help you to understand it better. Notice that the id of both df and df1 objects are the same. So wheth…
  


You can also filter warnings with the warnings library

You are using Jupyter Notebook, It can print tables. When printing your DataFrames instead of using the print() function you can use the Ipythons display function to pretty print DataFrames as tables.


Happy Learning!

Star Wars Survey - combined plots,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-combined-plots/547726,"
Hello @JamesDiu! Thanks for sharing:)
Well done on combining two plots on the same figure, it’s nice that you decided to experiment a bit.
As for the project, here is some feedback:

Your project has no title, you can make one that wraps up the objective of your project (and also the results if you can get them).
It’s better to avoid technical explanations in the Markdown text, you can leave it in the comments, while in the narratives you can concentrate on your motivation to do certain things.
You project has some typos, so make sure you get rid of them
It’s better to truncate the tables you have restricting them just to the first five rows: it’ll give an idea of its structures without occupying too much space.
It’s better to import all necessary libraries in the first code cell.
Why don’t you give more descriptive titles to your plots? For example Bar chart of the mean ranking: we already can see that this is a bar chart, no need to repeat it in the title.
You lack a conclusion where you wrap up all your results and answer the questions you asked in the beginning of the project.
Well done on commenting on your code. It was very helpful for me to understand what each code block was doing. It’s a useful skill to have.

Hope it helps:)
Happy coding

Hello @merimus! Thanks for sharing:)
Here is some feedback:

Your project lacks a title. Try to think about one which attracts attention and briefly summarizes what you analyzed.
I liked your comments on the findings! Well done:)
Well done on commenting your code, it’s an essential skill for any coder.
Be aware of the SettingWithCopyWarning. It can cause problems. You can read more about this warning here.
Your plots lack titles and axes labels, make sure you have them to be more clear in your presentation. You can also improve your plot style by despining them and make the labels bigger. I recommend the book Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals that will help you with data viz.
In the second section I cannot decipher what you communicate with the plots. I just skipped to the explanation below. It’s because your plots are not clear! It also happend to me in the third section.

Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News (newbies),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-exploring-hacker-news-newbies/547620,"
Hi @Pak I have gone through your  project and I want  to say congratulations for completing  the guided  project.Having say that I have got few suggestions;

You need to add more weight on your introduction. Remember it’s through the introduction that the reader can really get to know what your project is all about.It’s therefore recommended to include the aim of your projects, and give as well information background of the dataset you are using.
The format you have used to display some of the codes also needs little of improvement for example;

counts_by_hour = {}   #num of ask post each hour
comments_by_hour = {}   #num of comments ask posts created each hour

for row in result_list:
    date = row[0]
    num_comment = row[1]
    date_object = dt.datetime.strptime(date,""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M"")
    hour = date_object.hour
    if hour not in counts_by_hour:
        counts_by_hour[hour] =1
        comments_by_hour[hour] =num_comment
            else:
        counts_by_hour[hour] +=1
        comments_by_hour[hour] +=num_comment
print (count_by_hour)

with print () function , your output will be displayed horizontally, which to my view is not a good way to go.Instead you could have just call your dictionary name count_by_name
without the print () function and the output will be displayed vertically which is much easier to read.

Lastly you should also check on the comments, you have hardly used them in your code, same to conclusion.

Otherwise, everything looks good.
Happy learning!

Guided Project Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data - dazzletrail,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-dazzletrail/547588,"
Hi @dazzletrail,
Good to know that you finished this interesting project.
I’d like to start with the introduction. Intro section could have more details about the project, what problems are you trying to solve/address, the data set used etc. So it gives someone an overview of the whole project.
In order to rename the column names, you can also use
dataframe.rename({'oldname':'new_name', 'oldname2':'new_name2'},axis=1, inplace=True) 

In this way you don’t have to type the names that doesn’t need a change.
For the code below
autos['price'] = autos['price'].str.replace('$', '').str.replace(',', '')
autos['price'] = autos['price'].astype(int)

if you wish, you can chain the whole thing in one line as
autos['price'] = autos['price'].str.replace('$', '').str.replace(',', '').astype(int)

There are many different views regarding price outliers in this project. Whatever you mentioned sound right to me, when I was doing this project. Then I came across the idea that in ebay the auction starts at $1. So low prices can be right in certain cases.
Then another co-learner pointed out through a google search that there are people in Germany who list their cars on ebay for free! So that even makes $0 a valid entry! So you are free to choose whatever you think is right for the low price outlier after a careful examination of price values with these ideas in mind.
A small word about sonstige_autos. If you try to translate it from German to English, you will find that it means other_autos which probably means other brand names not mentioned in the data.
Anyway, you did a good analysis. It would have been great if you added a subheading for each section for a quicker read through the project. Same goes for the conclusion section as well.
Altogether it is a good job. Keep up the good work. Happy learning.

Hi @Scylla,
Good to see you again. It is an interesting project indeed. I like how you have structured it.
But I was wondering if it would be better if you had deviated from the instructions like you have done for the initial structuring of the project  and combined all the plot aetestic imporvement into one code block.
That way you wouldn’t be repeating a bunch of lines again and again just to make a few ticks and lines disappear.
A few things that might be useful to know are.
  ax1.tick_params(bottom=""off"", top=""off"", left=""off"", right=""off"", labelbottom='off')

Some times depending your version, On/Off might not work. Then you can try True/False
#Removes the spines for the all axis of all plots in first column
    ax1.spines[""top""].set_visible(False)
    ax1.spines[""right""].set_visible(False)
    ax1.spines[""bottom""].set_visible(False)
    ax1.spines[""left""].set_visible(False)

The above mentioned code can be changed to
for spine in ax.spines.values():   # Removing all 4 spines of a plot
        spine.set_visible(False)

Since ax.spines is stored as a dictionary, we can access the keys and values. So by using .values() you can select each spine and apply an operation.
You can alternatively use
for key,spine in ax.spines.items():      
        spine.set_visible(False)

I think that’s all from my side.
I have seen a few projects with quite clever loop to create the same results with very less number of lines of codes. I’m just mentioning that here in case you want to check some of the projects.
Anyway, I hope that you will find this useful. Happy learning.

GuidedProject: AppleStore GooglePlayStore data analysis,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guidedproject-applestore-googleplaystore-data-analysis/547492,"
Hi Raisa @raisa.jerin.sristy79
Good to see your project. Aren’t you moving up the ladder pretty quickly?! Congratulations on becoming a learning assistant.
Coming to your project, I think the introduction could have been a bit more elaborate, also by including a line or two about the data set and by giving a link to download the same. If you think from the perspective of a reader, someone who doesn’t know the guided projects in DQ, it will give you an idea on how to write and what to include.
Also, it would have been better if you could include some sub-headings just like you have mentioned here

removing inaccurate data
removing duplicate app entries
removing non-English apps
That way, it is easier to skim through the project for someone who isn’t very much interested in the coding part.

Well when it comes to coding, I’m sure you are pretty advanced and not starting from scratch. So I think you have done a pretty good job with the coding.
Though it would have been good if you could give how did you find about this
There is an inaccurate entry(10472) for googleplaystore , column_shift and the data for category is missing.

You can actually find it by comparing the number of columns and find the index of the that stands out like you have done here header_ios.index('prime_genre')
It is interesting to see how you have found the number of practical and entertainment apps. That was cool. Rest of the coding also looks good.
Well there is no right or wrong in the conclusion part. Though I think the company in the project didn’t want to invest too much and compete with giants if I remember correctly. So they might not get into social media. That is just my opinion.
Anyway it was a good project. Keep up the good work.

Guided-Project: Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-guided-project-exploring-hacker-news/547472,"
Hi Joe, @joe.shaer
Good to see that you have submitted a guided project here for review. If you are new to Python programming or not, your notebook really neat and pretty. Especially how you printed everything.
On that same note, you could have combined it all in one line, if you wish to do so.
print('HEADER')
print('======')
print(hn_header)
print('\n')

This can become
print('HEADER \n====== \n', hn_header)

Only thing is that you might not be able to find how many letters to type to create that ‘underline’ effect. But if you want more fun, you can get it using code itself by using len() to get the length of the string.
I know that I’m overcomplicating things, but here is my fun code to do that same.
print(' HEADER \n', ""=""* len('HEADER'), '\n', hn_header)

or

print('HEADER \n' + '='* len('HEADER') + '\n' + hn_header)

# 'string'*integer prints it n times. 
# eg 'a'*3 prints it 3 times like `aaa`

+ is used  instead of ,  because, the comma is creating extra white space.
Well thats about it. Now lets go to some standard ‘conventions’ like you have asked.
 total_ask_comments = total_ask_comments + num_comments
 total_ask_comments + =  num_comments

count = count + 1
count + = 1

You can use the second line in these cases as a shorthand and both works the same way.
But I can also see that you have already used all the above-mentioned points including the print(), further down in your code in extracting time. So probably, this was your decision to go with the longer version.
So finally I think you didn’t need those points.
Well, one more thing regarding the conclusion, the results are in EST. So mentioning the time zone would be a good idea.
Like I said earlier, I quite like the way you have created this project. I have a small suggestion though. Instead of saying Step 1, 2 etc, it would have been great if you could add what the step does as well, like for example reading data, cleaning data etc.
Otherwise, everything looks great. Happy learning.

One suggestion… I noticed you did a lot of formatting around ‘section headers’ in your output like ‘Posts per Hour’ and ‘Comments per Hour.’  How about creating a function that would apply a ‘standardized formatting’ around any of those output section headers?  That way you just call the function with the string you want to use.  Just a suggestion to minimize some code.
Otherwise really nice example and thanks for sharing!

Project Finding the Best Markets to Advertize in,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-finding-the-best-markets-to-advertize-in/546987,"
Hello @gavinyv! Thanks for sharing:)
Overall your project looks nice, I liked your conclusions: they look professional and concise.
Here is some feedback:

Your title isn’t very informative: you can specify the business branch you’d like to work with.
Make sure you have no warning! These are not errors but may potentially cause problems to your data.  You can read more about DtypeWarning here and about SettingwithCopyWarning here

In some cases your code is not uniform. Make sure you follow some Pythonic style guidelines like PEP-8

Your boxplot of “money spent per month” does not reveal much information, you can try to zoom in to identify further outliers.
Well done on testing if the data can be statistically significant by calcultaion the proportion of mode! It’s very important to udnerstand if our sample can be representative of the population and if it shifts to an extreme due to some outliers.

That’s all for me! Again: it’s a very nice and neat project.
Happy coding

Hello @solomo.obs! Thanks for sharing:)
Your project is nice: the comments are clear and precise. Your code is well-formatted and divided into separate blocks (well done on introducing new lines when it should be logically separated).
Here are some suggestions:

Provide a better explanation of the dataset you worked with (like, what’s in it and so on)

Write a more attractive title: like “When should you post on Hacker News?”

Comment on your code: make sure you explain each code block, it may not be necessary for the easy code but it’s important to develop this habit early on! It will save you many times in the future.

Try to use better subtitles: they should describe what infromation your want to obtain in that section, not the approach you used (well, it may be good for a tutorial). For instance,  Sorting and Printing Values from a List of Lists"" describes the approach not the analysis.

Correct some typos: it’s easy to correct it even with Word, and your project will only benefit from it.

That’s all for me! Happy coding

Looking for sincere feedback: NYC high school data,11,https://community.dataquest.io/t/looking-for-sincere-feedback-nyc-high-school-data/546814,"
@ksenia.kustanovich  Wow, I have to say your effort has definitely paid off. Your project looks absolutely amazing, thorough, and professional looking. I especially LOVE the plots you created.
I know what you are talking about with ‘digging in’ too much. I have felt that way with almost all of the guided projects. From my own experience, I learn the most when I dig deeper and go off the rail from the guides. Cause I’m motivated enough to find my own answers. Since we are learning right now, I don’t think digging deeper is going to cause any harm, most of the time, quite the contrary.
But then again, we do face the question of balancing how much deeper do you dig, and how much time do you spend on a project. That’s why I think it’s important to have a clear goal for each project. It may not be clear at first, and it may change as you explore the dataset more, but it’s helpful to keep the goals in mind. What I find helpful is to list the questions I want answers to from a project at the beginning, and you can always modify them as you go.
Again, great job on the project, I really admire the diligence and the time and thoughts you pour into this project.

Guided_Project3: Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project3-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/547141,"
Hello @cem.ayhan! Thanks for sharing:) You have a nice and neat project. Your explanations are clear and motivated. Here is some feedback I would leave on your project:

Make sure you explain beforehand what’s the goal of your project. Would you like to make some recommendations for people who’d like to buy/sell a car?
Also give a more descriptive title that encapsulates the essence of your project’s goal.
Comment on your code, even though it seems pretty straightforward right now (the code is relatively easy) it’s better to develop this useful skill early on in your data science journey. That will help others and the future you to understand what your code does.
In this code block:

autos = autos.loc[(autos[""registration_year""] > 1900) & (autos[""registration_year""] < 2017)]

did you want to extend the range up to 2017 (included)? If so you have to make sure to use the <= operator to include 2017. Correct if I did undestand incorrectly your motivations.

In the code blocks where you calculate the mean price/mileage for each brand you can use the mean() method to make it much quicker. You can also pass the mask directly to .loc[] to avoid creating another variable. You code will be shorter and still readable.
Make sure to write a longer conclusion. What was the main goal of your project? Did you reach it? Any other insignts you’ve found while exploring the dataset? Any further questions others can answer?

All in all, I liked your project! Well done:) You may come back when you learned about matplotlib and seaborn packages to make beautiful vizualiziations of your results.

Hey @lurepor,
Thanks for sharing your work with the community. First of all I must say that you have done a great work. You have optimized your codes very well by using simple technics with advanced thinking. I really like it and have lot to learn from your codes.
However, I would like to suggest few things that can make your project even better.


It is better to start your project by giving a brief introduction about the data set, the objective of the project and flow of the work that you are going to do etc.


As well as it is a good practice to explain your code blocks with either comments or markdown cell. Specially it will help readers to understand your codes and logic behind your codes.


Finally, adding a conclusion is really important as many readers are interested to know your findings from these analysis without going through your codes.


I think these points will make your project better.
Keep it up.
Cheers

When we assign a DataFrame to a new variable using =, we are not creating a new copy of the DataFrame. We are merely adding a new name to call the same object. The below example will help you to understand it better. Notice that the id of both df and df1 objects are the same. So wheth…

Hi @eas-sea
From where do you guys get the big brain, to analyze a dataset like this  ! Amazing work start to end 
You know that annoying journalist, who calls you and praises you on their show first thing, but then the first question they throw at you is quiet controversial ?! Yup that’s me 
So here comes my question - I quite didn’t understand the numbers you got for Reach Analysis.
What exactly are we comparing there. What I understand is they represent %ages but, how to really read them.
For instance, Resourceany column has 99, 99, 99, 100%. What exactly accounts 100 for USA?
Now, that I have raised my question, recall that when you give a befitting reply to the journalist and they are now closing the show, they pretend they are still best friends with you but still try to make a closing remarks which are actually directed “for your improvement and benefit”, here comes that…
Thanks for sharing this project with the community, and teaching me a new slang “boffins”. Also try to add these 2 lines to your import library code block, re-run the entire workbook, and observe the plots again.
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style = ""whitegrid"", font_scale = 1.3) # any number higher than 1 but lower than 1.5 (or you can experiment with this) & whitegrid is optional too.

Hello @jmerrell247! Thanks for sharing:)
You’ve done a good job. Here is what I liked:

Your plots are beautiful and I especially liked that you added a horizontal line at 50% to make them clearerer!
You wrote an brief introduction to the data you worked with.
You code is very well documented! It’s very important for every programmer. I liked that you commented what you were doing in each for loop (like plotting different degrees categories!).
You code is very well organized and neat except for some minor issues (like no spaces between characters or spaces between characters where thay shouldn’t be)
Each logical part of your code is separated by a blank space! It makes you code more readable.

Here is what can be improved:

You did write a brief introduction to the data but what about defining the project’s goals? What do you want to know from the data?
You projects lack a story behind it! What are the results? Could you comment them? Here is a good guide on how to write a good data science project.
What about adding a 50% label to you horizontal line? It will not cause many clutter on your plots but will make them more readable!
You can also add a global title for all your plots to clarify what they are all about.
You may also add the percentage symbol (%) to the 100 label to make it clear that you measure you data in percentages.

That’s all for me!

Hello @adrianzchmn, thanks for sharing your work. The general flow of your project is amazing, you’ve got a great Project Presentation Style.

As a Data Scientist always make sure you don’t repeat your self (DRY). Looking at this section, ** Cleaning columns with German words**, it would be great if you could create a function since there is a lot of repetition.


If you perform the same task multiple times in your code, consider a function or a loop to make your workflow more efficient.


just to let you know



Expand to see your code
print(autos[""price_usd""].unique().shape) #to see how many unique values


Pandas has a series method pd.Series.nunique that returns a number of unique elements.
print(autos.price_usd.nunique()) #to see how many unique values


As you continue learning, it would be great if you explore pd.to_datetime to convert argument to datetime. Then you can access any datetime property
A picture is worth 1000 words. Once you’ve learnt Data Visualization, make sure you’ve returned to this project and add some plots, it will make it too interesting and you’ll also obtain more insights…

Well done on defining the objective of your project and a brief explanation of the dataset
The link to Kaggle isn’t working
It’s great that you comment on your code! It’s a useful skill for every coder
You code sometimes present some small style issues. Be sure to adapt it to PEP-8 - the “official” Pythonic style. There are some other styles that are still similar to PEP-8.
Why did you write the function to renames the columns? For me, it seems a bit redundant.
Well job on finding the outliers! You used some statistical techniques and not just your intuition, it’s great. I will certainly use this method to get rid of outliers in my future projects.
In the conclusions you wrote what you’ve seen in the results of your analysis. But what are your conclusions? What do you think about them?

Here is some feedback:

Your project has no title! Try to think about one that summarizes the whole proejct and attracts one’s attention.
Write a deeper introduction. What are the main objectives of the project? Are you trying to find any correlation? Do you want to give an advice for someone who wants to sell their car on Ebay?
Describe better the dataset you’re using. What information does it contain?
Be clearer in your text: like what do you mean by renaming of columns (CamelCase)? I have seen plenty of the projects on this dataset so I know that you’re supposed to convert columns’ names from the CamelCase to the preferred Pythonic snake_case but for someone who reads this project for the first time your goal won’t be clear.
Comment your code! It’s very useful to understand what your code does (especially for you after months of not reading this code). Even though, in this project the code is fairly simple it’s good to get used to commenting it.
You can use multiple str.a_method functions in one line, one after another. Just think if your code is still readable.
You can include descriptive text to your print() statements to improve readability. I refer to the max and min values of odometer and price. You can use the format() method to include your variables into a string.
Why did you choose these prrices? Could you provide more explanation?
Well done on using the lambda function! It’s quite advanced.
Could you write a more comprehesive conclusion? That’s why you need to better define the question you want to answer at the beginning of the project and then wrap up all the results in conclusions.

Overall, I liked your project. It’s neat and has no major issues. I hope my feedback will be helpful to you

Hello @riffology! Thanks for sharing:)
Here is some feedback:

First off, why do you have a code block to install conda? It’s not neccessary for the project.
Why did you copy everything from the DQ, especially Jupyter notebook explanations. Try to use your own words whenever possible and don’t just copy everything from DQ. At a real job, we have no place to copy from.
As far as I see you left no comments on the data you extracted and just copied everything (at least at the beginning).
Most of your cells do not have the same style. You can corret your code style by reading these guidelines.

Overall, I would reccomend you two main things:

Do not blindly copy everything from DQ (and other guides). At least try to rephrase what they say in your own worlds.
Comment your findings. What did you expect? What did you find? Is it worth mentioning?

Same goes with the introduction in your project. I couldn’t find the name of the guided project. If I hadn’t done this project before, I wouldn’t be able to figure out more about the project easily.
Coming to the project, it would be better if you could add title to the scatter plots. It makes the plots self-explanatory. Also, if you can leave some of your observations from these plots after each plot, that would also be great for easier reading.
For histogram also, titles and labels will create better readability.
Also, you have used range=(0,5000). In certain plots there are no histogram. Maybe they are outside this value. Please have a look and try full range.
Rest looks good. But if you can add more conclusions from each plot and summarise it at the end, that would be great. Also, please include titles for the plots.

Hi @shas,
What can I say about your project?! This is one of the most detailed and original Profitable App Project I have personally seen on DQ community. I feel that I can only review it if I have done a better job than you. Since that is not the case, I will just stick to the things I learned and enjoyed from this project.
I have always seen (including in my case) people removing the whole row with missing data. It is for the first time I’m seeing someone finds what is missing and then finds out the missing data and inserting it at the right place. That was nice. But I just wish, you’d have included the step how you found the row with missing value.
The whole project was easy to read. It also gave a lot of explanations and insights. Overall it is a great work.
Usage of markdown is awesome. Loved the headings, subheadings and the structure. Smart usage of preformatted words. Hence the flow is also good. I think I have already mentioned about the data cleaning approach. It was great as well. By this time you have created quite a lot of expectations. So I was very curious to find your conclusion. But when I got to the conclusion, I felt like it was being rushed and slightly inspired by DQ instructions. I’m pretty sure you’d have come up with a more groundbreaking conclusion with a bit more time. Anyway it is really amazing project. Looking forward to going through more of your future projects.
Happy learning.

I read your whole project and overall it was really fun to read! I could feel that you were also having fun while doing this project and it really reflected on the narratives and conclusion. And the story about your friend and all really strengthen and emphasized a clear goal of this project, so it was really great.
I found your idea of using count = 0 variable to limit the printed titles to 10 very creative and educative for me. But, I counted the titles, and it was 11 instead of 10,  so I think you should’ve limited it to count < 10 instead.
And then, this part: I don’t know if this is what you mean by printing the variable name used, but maybe this is a way to do it?? I hope so.
def indexer(dataset_header, variable_name):        
    index=0
    print(""Index of {}"".format(variable_name))

Hello @eas-sea,
Excellent job. You found a way to see all relevant correlations and do a very simple and clear job, I only have a few recommendations:

Your map could be improved greatly using folium or plotly.
I love how you deal to find outliers, and the trick to transverse the columns, I use plotly to visually see the outliers, but your trick is more neat.
You didn’t categorize using a function to further explore, it was not necessary but seeing all your good job maybe you would find even more.

I totally love your project: simple, with nice tricks, and found relevant information that helps to understand better the SAT scores predictors.

EBAY (Kleinanzeigen) Used Cars Analysis - Feedback,7,https://community.dataquest.io/t/ebay-kleinanzeigen-used-cars-analysis-feedback/540488,"
Hi @karimyousrymohamedom,
You have gone beyond the general instructions and took up the extra instructions as well which is a great thing.  I just felt that you could have used the markdown cells more and added more explanations to make your project more readable and understandable for not so technical people as well. Ending the project with a proper conclusion is also important. At times people might only be interested in the conclusions.
You have converted the date columns but didn’t use it for any purpose. Maybe you can experiment with them to find some insights.
Overall you did a good job. By adding a conclusion to your work, it will become more useful. Hope this helps.

GP : Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys,14,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/526021,"
Hello @biadboze! Thanks for sharing.
You did a rather good job and here is some feedback:

You copied the whole Dataquest introduction that is not fair. It’s ok if you cannot invent another way of asking the question but try to rephrase at least the introduction.
Your code blocks have comments! That’s a useful habit because it helps you and other people in understanding your code.
You also copied the DQ instructions in the “Verification of data” section.
What does your boxplot represent? What information would you like to communicate to us? Give it a title, axes labels and some explanation below.
In your second plot you lack a title and x axis label. It’s also a good idea to order the categories in a logical way (like from New to Veteran) to help the readability. You also do not need any rotation because the horizontal view of the categories is the best one.
Could you give more motivation for categorizing NaN values in the categorizeNaN function? You add a considerable amount of data that can have a great impact on the results.
When you visualize the number of dissatisfied employees by position what message do you want to transmit? A plot cannot be there just for the sake of visualization, it should communicate some useful information.
You have some typos in the narratives.
Your code style isn’t always the same: like having or not having spaces before and after the commas in methods.
You have no conclusion. Wrap up all the results you have, did you answer the initial question? What are the most important insights into your analysis?

I advise your yo read this article on the project style. For the data visualization part, I recommend reading “Storytelling with Data”.
Happy coding:)

Project : Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-investigating-fandango-movie-ratings/546381,"
Hi @gavinyv,
Good job on your first project submission. Your project is quite clear and concise as you intended. I also noticed all your plots had their appropriate titles and axis labels. Good job on that too. Your project looks good for a first submission but there are are a few things I’d make note of:


when viewing a dataframe, it’s better to use the df.head() function to view a subset of the dataframe and not the entire thing. This is to prevent unnecessary scrolling.


concise is good but try to be a little more explanatory in your documentations so as to carry the reader along more easily. It’s called story-telling for a reason.


I noticed an empty code cell at the very bottom of your notebook, below the conclusion, and the ninth code cell was also empty. You should remove both of them to make your project a little neater.


Overall, I like your project. It’s quite good for your first submission. Why don’t you submit your previous guided projects for review as well? I’m sure the feedback you receive for those projects would also help you in your journey to becoming a seasoned data analyst.
I look forward to seeing more submissions from you!

Good to see that you have uploaded your new guided project here. Looks like you have done everything mentioned in the instructions. But I felt that the code blocks were more like an island not connected with each other. You could have used a little bit more of the markdown cell to explain the code cells and why you did what you did. That will bring more flow to the project and even a non-technical reader will be able to understand a few things from the analysis you’ve made.
Similarly it will be a good idea to add a conclusion part at the end explaining the findings you have made from the analysis. Hope this helps.

Guided Project Ebay vehicles sale,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-ebay-vehicles-sale/456036,"
Hello @tiago_netor! I hope I’m not too late for the feedback:)
What I liked:

You did some analysis that wasn’t requested by DataQuest (and you used another dataset!).
You thoroughly describe each step and motivate your choices.
You did your best to impute the missing data (like for vehicle type, well done!)
You have sections that logically separate your project.
You comment your code.
You used pivot tables to group the data.

What can be improved:

Your project has no title.
Be aware that Model Year and Year of Registration are two different things.
Adapt your code to the PEP8 standard. It will improve readability.
Some of your plots have no title and/or axes labels.
The axes labels for year have unneccessary values like 2013.5. Maybe it’s better to use just the years? It will remove a lot of clutter from the plots.
I’m not sure about your conclusion of the recalled models for Volkswagen and Audi. Where do you se the number of recalled cars? Or recalled modes? For it would be BMW with three recalled models.
And what about the other years? Describe them too:)
You miss conclusions. What was the goal of your project? Wrap up the results in the conclusive part.

That’s all for me!

Hi @nikdimi
Congratulations on finishing and sharing your project here.
Looks like you have followed everything mentioned in the instructions very promptly. So all the coding looks good.
Though there are a few things that can make your project even better.

It is a good idea to start any project by giving a bit of introduction about the data set, the goal of the analysis, what and how you are going to go about the whole process etc. It gives an idea to the reader who doesn’t have any idea about this project, some context. So please include an introduction using the markdown cells.



Similarly, it will be good to give an explanation of the code block or the logic of the code using markdown cells. An alternate code block and markdown cell looks great and makes for an easy read.


Conclusion is one of the most important part of any project. Most of the people would be interested in knowing what you have found out from these analysis rather than going through all the code blocks. From the perspective of a reader who wants to know about the gender gap, they would be more interested in the conclusion part.


If you are planning to create a portfolio out of these guided projects, these points will be very important. The below mentioned link will be helpful if you want to read more about it.

Regarding the coding part:
In certain guided projects, its better to take a personal call and deviate from the exact instruction. Well, this is my personal opinion. But in this case, you actually need the last code cell with all the changes made to the initial plot. Others are simply repeating most part of the same code.
Another point is that
    ax.spines[""right""].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines[""left""].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines[""top""].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines[""bottom""].set_visible(False)

You have used this code and
for key,spine in ax.spines.items():
        spine.set_visible(False)

There is one more variation, if you are interested in knowing.
for spine in ax.spines.values():
        spine.set_visible(False)

In this version, you only need to use one iterating variable.
Another thing which might help you in future is this
ax.tick_params(bottom=""off"", top=""off"", left=""off"", right=""off"")

In some version(mostly latest versions) “off” might not work. Instead you will have to use the Boolean values, True and False.
If any time On/Off doesn’t work try True/False
I think these points can make your project better. Hope it helps.
Altogether, the coding part was good. Keep up the good work. Happy learning.

Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-mobile-app-for-lottery-addiction/533333,"
Hi
Great job on this project.
I really like that you made the functions interactive.
One thing that you might be interested in checking for the future is to introduce assert statement.
An assert statement can help you to enforce a precondition in just one line of code.
For example, if you want the user to input a number n between 2 and 5, you could write:
assert n in [2,3,4,5], “Number out of range.”
If n in [2,3,4,5] is true, then the code will continue to run; if it is False, the error message "" Number out of range"" will display.
You can read more about assert statements on this [link][ https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/assert-statement].
Other than that, you have done a great job on the interactive functions.

Explanations - Add more explanations for your project. Let your readers know what you are doing and why you are doing it. Also, explain your findings.

Efficiency - you could make this code more efficient by using a python built-in function Enumerate which adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object.



Your New Column Names and Indexes code
for i in range(len(autos.columns)):
    print(i, autos.columns[i])


This is how it could look like if you use enumerate:
for i, col in enumerate(autos.columns):
print(i, col)

Predicting Stock Market Prices Guided Project,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-stock-market-prices-guided-project/534951/3,"
Hi, thanks for sharing your project!  I think I’ve found the mistake in your code when you were calculating features.
For example, when you are calculating average price from the past 5 days, you don’t need to include data from the current day, otherwise, the features would have a strong correlation with the target column (or in other words: features would have an insight about the target column).
So, when you calculate the average price from the past 5 days for date=‘1950-01-10’, you need to use ‘close price’ from dates[‘1950-01-03’, ‘1950-01-04’, ‘1950-01-05’, ‘1950-01-06’, ‘1950-01-09’]. But In your project, you can see that the first day when your code calculated the ‘Avg Price 5 Day’ is ‘1950-01-09’ instead ‘1950-01-10’.
Hope that helps!

Hi @Scylla,
Congratulations on finishing this guided project.
There are a few things which you could have done differently.
To rename the column names, you can use multiple name changes within the {}
autos.rename(columns={
""yearOfRegistration"" : ""registration_year"",
""monthOfRegistration"" : ""registration_month""}, inplace=True)

So you don’t actually need the while loop. Though it is a creative way of doing it.
I like how you have used percentage_gap_mean_mileage  to come to a conclusion. It would be great if you could summarise other conclusions as well in the last part. Altogether this is a good project. Happy learning.

Hello @biadboze! Thanks for sharing:)
I hope my feedback will still be useful to you.
Here is what I liked:

You have a precise goal you want to reach with this project.
You motivate and explain each step you perform.
Your overall analysis is clear and thorough.

Here is what can be improved:

Comment your code. It will help you and the other to understand what each code cell does. Now it’s easy to understand because your code is simple but once you analysis becomes advance it’s essential to comment the code.
In the cell 3, you can just write autos.head() to shot the first five rows of the dataset. It will be presented in a more readable way.
Is it the best way to rename the columns? What if you mistake the order? Try to think of another approach.
Are you sure about this: “almost all the data of name column and seller column are same”? You have 38754 unique values in the name column.
In the code cell 10 you can improve the code style by aligning all used methods.
In many code cells you have some minor style issues. Try to adapt them to a Pythonic PEP-8.
You have some typos, especially at the end of the project.
Write conclusions. Did you do what you wanted? What are the results? What can be investigated further?

That’s all for me! Happy coding:)

It is cumbersome to code several plots, but more the plots, more intriguing the project becomes. Generally, if there are too many plots, one could always use more sophisticated tools that minimize coding inputs.
I haven’t done this project yet, hence I am unable to give more technical feedback sorry.
Thanks

Gender gap in college degrees - nested loop,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gender-gap-in-college-degrees-nested-loop/543414,"
Hi @alexminos,
That’s a nice submission you’ve made. Good job avoiding hardcoding values as much as possible. However, I have a few suggestions:

Include a project title. This is to help readers know what this project is about.
Document what you are doing so it’s easy for others to follow. Your documentation doesn’t have to be lengthy. Small blocks of text describing the results of code cells or decisions you make or even thoughts you have about the way the project should go will help readers understand your project better.
It’s helpful to document what you find interesting about your plots. About 3 - 5 insights is a good amount.
It’s helpful to include a conclusion at the end of the project. It should be a summary of the takeaways from the project. Something the reader can go through and get the full gist of the entire project.

I holp this helps!

Guided Project : Employee Exit Survey [Feedback Requested],1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-employee-exit-survey-feedback-requested/408368,"
Hello @sam_47! Thanks for sharing;) Hope it’s not too late for feedback.
Here it is:

You can just use the  dataframe.head() code to print the top rows of a dataframe in a readable way.
Try not copying from DQ. Use your own words wherever and whenever possible.
How could you improve your code style? You can read more about the code style here

In the code cell 15 could you use another approach to find out if a string contains the “Resignation” substring?
Try to use a less saturated color than red for your plot.
Why didn’t you continue to answer the question? It wouldn’t have taken much time and you would have obtained more interesting results.

That’s all for me! Happy coding;)

Hi @jmstombler,
I love your project! Its definitely looks a lot professional in my opinion. Its very explanatory and its easy for me to follow what you are doing.  I also noticed that you used comments to explain what each block of code does, Good job on that. Well done noting some the important stats and the courses where there are significant changes in the gender gaps. And your conclusion is quite detailed. Nice work.
The only thing I think you need to tidy up is the fourth code cell, You should delete it since its all commented out. Overall, this is a very good project and I enjoyed going through it.

Here is some feedback:

You are working with the factbook.db database. sql_master is just a table of tables in the database.
Correct your mistakes, in some cases your narrative is unreadable.
You do not need to call %%sql in each code cell. Just one time will be enough.
Correct your sql style according to a style guidelines (for example, here.

Hi @jhnafrin06,
Good to know that you found this project to be fun. You have done a good job finishing it.
A few points that comes to my mind are as below



In this project we will visualize a csv file that has data set containing the percentage of bachelor’s degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012.We will also generate and show the percentage of men within the same time interval.



Along with this, you could have mentioned a little bit more about the data set, where to find them etc. When you publish this for other users it will be helpful for them.
Another thing is that
    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)    
    ax.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)  

Since ax.spines is stored as a dictionary, you can loop through it and disable all by following the below-mentioned code.
for spine in ax.spines.values():                         
        spine.set_visible(False)

Rest everything looks good. Maybe you could have added a title for the conclusion part.  Hope this helps.

Hi @abdulrahman.hawila,
Thanks for sharing your project. Here are some comments from my side for your consideration.

Project structure: adding title, introduction, conclusion, sub-sections with sub-subheadings.
Adding markdown cells with explanations what steps were made and why.
It was enough to read the file in pandas once, as well as to assign colors and create lists of categories.
Probably it was not necessary to introduce the variable i, just to write the number 3 instead.
A good practice is to re-run al the cells after finishing the project. In this case all the code cells are in order and easy to follow.

Hope my comments were useful. Happy coding!

 agustinterissi:

The idea is to learn how to shape projects in a professional way in order to build a portfolio that I can present in an interview.


Great. There are some things you’ve missed to make your project more professional.

Data Exploration - You need to explore the data to be familiar with it.
i. shape of the data
ii. the data types of the columns
Exploratory & Graphical Data Analysis - Explore the data fully. Do the Univariate Data Analysis, Bivariate Data Analysis, Make plots, these will aid you in getting insights before doing modelling.

Project Visualizing Earnings Base on College Majors,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-visualizing-earnings-base-on-college-majors/523375,"
Hi @fh8888!
Thank you for sharing your project. Great job on the code – I had really similar workflow. I have just a few notes:

In line[4], you do not need to use the recent_grads.index, you can simply use recent_grads with the len() function
In line[14], you do not need to use
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111)
you can abbreviate the code to…
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
…since you are creating just the one graph in one plot

The graph from line[14] (Men & Women vs. Median Income) was my favorite and I incorporated something similar into my own project.
I hope this helps. Thank you again for sharing your work. Happy learning!

Review Guided Project: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-guided-project-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors/450051,"
Hello @eashwary! Thanks for sharing:)
Here is what I liked:

You have clear project’s objections
You have sections that logically split your project
Some of your plots have a title and axes labels
You have interesting observations and zoom-ins in some cases to further investigate a relationship between two variables (like Total vs. Median) still this observations may be described better.

Here is what can be improved:

Add more subsections: like when you investigate a particular relationship.
Define a clearer project’s style (like in some cases you have Observation and in others Observations or OBSERVATION.
Give all your plots a meaningful title and axes labels. You can also give axes ticks (for dollars, it’s usually an y axes) a dollar symbol (for the top tick).
In which currency is your money? You just provide numbers without any symbol.
Comment your code! What does a particular code cell does? It’s rather easy to understand when your code is easy like in this project but it will become a useful habit once your code becomes more complex.
In some scatter plots your points are truncated due to tight limits you’ve set.
Remove grids from your histograms, they do not provide any information and just distract readers.
Your histograms can have more meaningful titles: like what does Median mean? Median salary, number of emplyees or something else? I can decipher this but it would have been easier for me and other reader (and for the future you) if the plot had a clearer title.
Here is an example of a plot with no labels and title: the plot under The ShareWomen column contained the percentages , woman as share of total. We can try splitting into 2 bins and observe.. What does it represent? Where are the percentages? What does y label mean? It took me around a minute to figure out what this plot means and how it’s linked to the observations. Most employers or stakeholder wouldn’t lose time trying to find out what you wanted to say:)
At the end you have a series of plots with no observations at all!
Write a conclusion. Did you answer the questions? What interesting data have you found? Wrap it all up. Most end users are only interested in the conclusions.

Hope it helped! Happy coding:)

Hi @PriyankKrishnamoorth,
Congratulations on finishing this project.
There are a few things that I noticed which can be done differently too.
You have used similar code to print the list of list.
for post in hn:
    if index == 5:
        break;
    print(post)
    print("""")
    index += 1

maybe you can use
hn[:5] to print first 5 rows of the list of lists.
Also these three lines of codes can be combined if you wish to do so.
print(""Number of Ask HN posts: "")
print(len(ask_posts))
print(""\n"")

as
print(""Number of Ask HN posts:"", len(ask_posts), ""\n"")

Rest everything looks great. The markdown cell explanations are nice. So is the conclusion.
If you want to experiment more you can check pytz library so that you can use it to convert different timezones.
Hope this helps

Congratulation on finishing this project. I have also finished this very recently. This is a challenging one. Isn’t it?
First of all it would be great if you can upload the notebook in ipynb format.

Anyway here is your notebook in ipynb format for anyone who wants to have a look at your project.
guided project 4.ipynb (335.0 KB)
So I have gone through your project and it looks good. But there are so many more things you could have added in the project, that is what I felt.
I can see that you have followed all the major instructions diligently which is great. But it would have been great if you could add your observation from each of the plots you have created.
download369×514 17.5 KB
For example, in this you could have said Astronomy and astrophysics has more women percentage among the 10 highest paying majors.
In the same example, you have used
recent_grads[:10].plot.bar(x = ""Major"", y =""ShareWomen"")
recent_grads[163:].plot.bar(x = ""Major"", y =""ShareWomen"")

You can also use head(10) and tail(10) get the first and last 10 rows.
recent_grads.tail(10).plot.bar(x = ""Major"", y =""ShareWomen"")

So my main suggestion would be to add some of your observations from the plots you have created.  I hope this helps.Click here to view the jupyter notebook file in a new tab

Hi @aniefiokuduakobong ,
Your project looks great, the data analysis is very thorough and profound.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration.


Emphasizing more the project title. I just mean to make the letters bigger  The same about conclusion.


In case of this dataset, it’s better not to remove all the prices below 25 and above 75 percentiles. They are all real prices (apart from the absurd maximum price that is clearly wrong), and these rows contain also a lot of other valuable information.


The markdown cell after the code cell [12] (and in some other parts of the project). Probably it would be better not to describe in detail the methods of data analysis that are going to be applied. In markdown cells it’s better to give some explanations of the results / observations rather than technical approaches.


For the rest, great job!
Good luck with your next Dataquest projects!

Hi @Elena_Kosourova,
Congratulations on finishing a bit tougher guided project and also for becoming one of the community champions of this week.
I have gone through your project and there are a few things that comes to my mind.


Initially, you have printed the full autos df which demands me to scroll through the whole dataset. As a reader, I might not be interested in scrolling through the whole dataset. You could have used df.head()  and df.tail() instead.


I have seen this code before. This can be done differently too.


def camel_to_snake(str): 
    res = [str[0].lower()] 
    for c in str[1:]: 
        if c in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'): 
            res.append('_') 
            res.append(c.lower()) 
        else: 
            res.append(c) 
      
    return ''.join(res) 

# Converting the column names
new_columns = []
for c in autos.columns:
    column_snake = camel_to_snake(c)
    new_columns.append(column_snake)

Could you please tell me where did you get this idea? I have seen others also following this code on other guided projects while reviewing it. Now I am curious about the source of inspiration for this line of code.
dataframe.rename()

Since you are using this method to change the column names, in fact you can actually type the required column name with snake case straightaway. But I do agree that it will be a good thing to know how to do it with a function, especially when we have many names to change.

About the price outliers, I agree that the higher values can be too high and are outliers. But do you think there will be free cars ? Maybe on ebay it starts with $1?

Rest everything looks great. Probably conclusion could have been bullet points for easier reading.
There are many thing I quite enjoyed and learned.

I quite like how you have come to 1927 as the starting year for the registration_year column. That was a cool logic.
Also, it is nice that you took time to do the extra instructions such as mapping the German to Engilsh, finding the damaged car prices and so on.

unrepaired = autos.groupby('unrepaired_damage')['price_dollars'].mean()

From this I got to learn groupby function.
In total, this project looks great. I’m pretty sure that you had a lot of fun doing this. Keep up the great work. Happy learning.

Hello @pudgiko, thanks for sharing your work. Everything seems ok. To make it even more interesting, you could have provided us with explanations of the findings. You can check this topic that has guidelines on how to make a professional project.




Some guidelines for the guided or personal projects Share


    You all are doing well. But I want to share some guidelines for guided or pet projects. Please try to follow the guideline. 


Make proper documentation for your project . 
At the very beginning of your project, add some information about the problem you are trying to solve with this project. Don’t use any technical word for the documentation. So, that people, in general, can easily realize your documentation. Try to add documentation to each part of the project.

GP: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors. Feedbacks appreciated,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors-feedbacks-appreciated/495120,"
Hello @gbpignatti5! Thanks for sharing:) You did a good and funny work. I enjoyed reading your project (especially the narattives).
Here is some feedback:

Your project lacks sections, if you add them it will improve readability.
In the code cell 10 your code: recent_grads = cleaned_recent_grads. You may just use the new variable instead of reassigning it back to the original variable. Who knows if you will need the original dataframe.
You did a great data cleaning work by noticing strange values in the Unemployed and Unemployed rate columns.
Your plots lack axes labels, and you can also use light-grey vs. another color scheme to attract attention to the most important data (like “Engineering is by far the category of major that makes you more rich”).
You comment your code! It’s a useful habit.
Try to use less saturated colors for your bar plots, although some of your code blocks have no comments.
You can bold the most important insight you had in the conclusions:)

That’s all for me.
Happy coding;)

Guided Project Feedback: Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-feedback-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/498810,"
Hello @lsuepb! Thanks for sharing.
Your project is overall good work, I liked reading it.
Here is some feedback:

Good use of code comments, they are helpful. However, I would opt for a more precise description of what each code block does. It may seem quite useless in your case since the code in the project is relatively easy I everyone can understand what you mean by writing “# checking the new values” (code cell 26) but as you become writing more complex code it’s a good habit to be as precise as possible. So it this case you could write something like this: “Print unique values in the odometer column to verify the data”. I’m still learning to write comprehensive comments so you can think of a better way to comment it! I hope to have given you the right way:)
Some of your bullets are more comments to code than subtitles: like “Converting strings to integers”. You may want to write a more detailed explanation of what you do or just leave it be!
Here, After this quick analysis, we are now going to remove the outliers (lines that has cars’ prices less than 50 and more than $1.000.000, could you motivate your choice? On eBay, some cars can start from 1$ because they are on auction so they can start at a low price.
You have some minor typos in your text!
It’s not clear for me why it is possible to conclude that ads created before March 2016 are considered as outliers since the ads can be created even before they were crawled?
Could you write conclusions? Try to answer these questions:

What was the objection of your project?
Have you accomplished it?
What are your results? Any comments?
Any future analysis to do?



That’s all! Hope it helps.
Happy coding:)

Hello,
I really like your project! It will make you stand out.
You have your own unique style so it is hard for me to tell you what you should improve. I like the way you explain the steps you are taking.
Only few suggestions:

maybe you could add comments in your code (you add it but not consistently)
in Analyzing Sales Data By Country and Exploring Playlist Composition sections a lot of happens (tables, plots visualizing the data) but there is little text describing consequently what is going on. What do you think about working on this part more?

The presentation style looks great, it is well styled it makes thus making it easy to follow along what you are doing.

You have a very nice presentation style, this makes us easy to follow what you are doing.
So about importing the modules it would be great if you could put all the importations at the beginning of the project, just next to the introduction to the project. This will make people who are running your NoteBook know what libraries are required.
Another thing I’ve not seen is how you handled the missing values, did you ignore them?

I have gone through your project and overall it is nice. I would like to mention one point for better improvement of your project -
Our conclusions should match our goal - In this project we were able to extract, clean and review a small portion of their unclean listing data related to cars from 2016. Through the course of cleaning you have  removed a lot of rows based on assumptions. After cleaning the data you have used to extract meaningful insights. Thus meeting the goal that was set at the start of this project, but its good to add these points in the end which will give a clear picture to audience.
And also if if you would like to improve your data analysis skills and make your hands dirty , you can definitely extend your analysis for this project

Hello @nishant.jani11 Welcome to the Community.
After looking at your project I’ve noticed all your markdown paragraphs are heading


An example of a paragraph from your code
The project is about the free apps on Google Play and App Store and how they generate revenue based on in-app advertisements. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.
The goal of the project is to analyze data to help the app developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

Headings are used as titles and to signal a section. It would be great if you’ll make some of your headings be paragraphs.
Happy Coding!.

Hello @saquibmehmood1 I’ve carefully gone through your project, you’ve done a great job in explaining your findings, your project flow is very organized.
About the title
Well the title of the project to me since I’ve have statistical/computing knowledge is easy to understand but to newbies It will be a bit difficult to understand just by reading the title. It would be great if you provide a great title that can be easily be understood by people with less computing knowledge.
Code efficiency
The codes are efficient, you’ve got meaningful variable and function name they really help in readability. The only concern comes in your last code


your code
for list in observed_expected:
    total = sum(list)
    total_prop = total/jeopardy.shape[0]
    high_value_exp = high_value_count * total_prop
    low_value_exp = low_value_count * total_prop
    
    observed = np.array([list[0], list[1]])
    expected = np.array([high_value_exp, low_value_exp])
    chi_squared.append(chisquare(f_obs = observed, f_exp = expected))


The iterator variable here you’ve named it list remember list is a builtin function name. It would be awesome if you named this variable another thing.
Variables often hold instances of classes so they should be nouns observed_expected, observed, and expected are verbs…

Hi,
I really liked some of your functions. Especially, function converting camelCase labels to snake_case. It can also be used for Pascal convention also as you lowered first letter.

Star Wars Survey: Feedback request,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-feedback-request/467468,"
Hello @ivelinagenova! Thanks for sharing. You did a great job.
Here is some feedback:

If I’m not mistaken you copied the introduction from the DataQuest instructions. if it is the case, be aware that it is not fair, try to avoid copying the narratives from others!
In the code cells 142 and 147 you import Numpy and Matplotlib, respectively, it’s a good practice to import all the necessary libraries at the beginning of the project
Try to shorten the ode comments: you can just write “Rename …” without using “Let’s”
Are you sure "" that Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back received the highest average scores from the respondents of the survey, whereas Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith received the lowest average scores.""? It does not seem to be a case from the plot.
Try to give more meaningful paragraphs’ names. Like what does “By gender” imply? I understand what it means because I read the entire project but for a person that is just scrolling the project for specific information it’s hard to understand the meaning.
The plot “Movie rankings by education level” is very colourful, it’s dificult to extract the most important information from it. You can change the situation by coloring only the bars that are most important. I advise you to read the book “Storytelling with Data”. You can visit the site.
The previous point applies also to the next plot.
In the plot “Who shot first” what does “%” mean? It’s important to be very clear with what each axis means. Is it the percentage of respondents?
It’s a good idea to add labels to each axis to avoid any misinterpretation.
What’s written above applies also to the plot “Overall favorite characters”: colorful and without an x axis label.
Could you write a more complete conclusion? Try to wrap up all the information you gained while analyzing the dataset. It’s also useful to include a small summary of the results at the beginning of the project.

Overall you did a great job, I liked reading your project.
Happy coding!

GP: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/518699,"
Good work with the cleaning and analysis @dianamartinr85 . Although permit me to make some suggestions
First, to make your codes look neater, you should avoid repeating certain lines (DRY programming), for instance, instead of this:
ax.spines[""right""].set_visible(False)    
ax.spines[""left""].set_visible(False)
ax.spines[""top""].set_visible(False)    
ax.spines[""bottom""].set_visible(False)

You could do:
for spine in [""right"", ""left"", ""top"", ""bottom""]:
           ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)

or:
for key, spine in ax.spines.items():
         spine.set_visible(False)

Also, since you were going to use the above codes (and the ax.set_ylim(), ax.set_yticks(), ax.tick_params()) more than once, you could make your code neater by putting those repeated lines in a function and calling it when needed …
But good work nonetheless … happy learning!

Hello @ahadov.rufat, I just finished and posted this guided project myself, so it was nice for me to take a look at how others went about it. I noticed that you approached the dataset from different perspectives ( gear type, mileage, damages, healthycar etc) and added many new columns for your analysis. understood from your conclusion, you used the project to practice  concepts. I agree with you about that 100% - more opportunity to memorize the better! ( I keep lots of notes).  Hope you plan to add to it the challenges under next steps.

Hi @ivelinagenova
Congrats! Project looks good. Interpret the metrics is hard for all newbies, i still don’t feel that i can interpret them at 100%, but in my experience:

Linear Regression: Works perfectly, both train and test error are similar. Obviously in MSE they are going to be really high because every value is squared, but RMSE have only a 0.4 point difference, so no problem at all
Decision Tree: As every decision tree, it’s overfitted. But it is normal in DT. When min_samples_leaf = 5, the difference between train and test reduced but it’s still overfitted
Random Tree: The first one is overfitted, the second one has a difference of 10 points i don’t consider it as an overfitted model but i’m not sure

A good explanation of overfit/underfit is found here
I’m agree with your final conclusion
That’s all i have to say, good luck!

Hello @erzinrost! Thanks for sharing:)
You did a great job developing a complex project and using a lot of methods to answer the questions (like plotly and scikit). Here are some observations:

You neat description is great! But could you shorten and simplify it? It was quite difficult at the end to follow your narratives
What do you want us to see on your plots? Try to emphasize the bars that communicate the most important information.
You can improve your stacked barplot (socio-cultural factors) by making the legend to follow the order of bars, it will greatly improve legibility.
You can write a smaller summary fo results at the beginning of the project. Often, it’s the only information people will read (yeah, TL;DR but this the reality)

Hope it helps! Happy coding:)

Some guidelines for the guided or personal projects Share


    You all are doing well. But I want to share some guidelines for guided or pet projects. Please try to follow the guideline. 


Make proper documentation for your project . 
At the very beginning of your project, add some information about the problem you are trying to solve with this project. Don’t use any technical word for the documentation. So, that people, in general, can easily realize your documentation. Try to add documentation to each part of the project.

G-P: Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/g-p-visualizing-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees/493260,"
Hello @biadboze! Thanks for sharing:)
Your code is nice but here is what lacks:

Add more comments to your code, it will help you and others to understand it better
Comment your finding! What’s the problem, how you approached it? What decisions have you made? What’s the result?
Write conclusins: wrap up all you’ve written and link it to the project objectives. Have you reached the result you wanted?

Happy coding:)

Guided Project - Exploring Hacker News Posts - When Is the Best Time to Ask Hacker News?,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-exploring-hacker-news-posts-when-is-the-best-time-to-ask-hacker-news/522063,"
Hi @devtronvarma,
Congratulations on finishing the guided project and sharing your first post here. Welcome to the community.
You have done a nice job with Hacker news analysis. Also you have given enough explanations about your code in the markdown cell. So all in all your code was an easy to follow project.  The only thing I can think of suggesting is mentioning ‘EST’, the timezone. You have mentioned about US at the conclusion. But maybe if we can add ‘EST’ while printing the top 5 times to post, it would be nicer.
Also, you can use pytz library to convert time to other timezones if you wish to add that too.
Other than that, everything looks fine. Keep up the good works and Happy learning.

Hi @tcharkovskii,
I loved the style of your plots. There were also proper labels to indicate which line represents men and which represents women. The axis was also labeled and ticked and you included titles for each plot. I also liked that you mentioned some stats that you got from the plots. Good job. I have a suggestion though, don’t use comments unless they’re for stating something that isn’t already expressed by the code. Your code should be self-explanatory so if you write comments, they should say something that’s relevant but is not expressed in the code.
Happy coding!

Predicting Stock Market Guided Project,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/predicting-stock-market-guided-project/519423,"
Hi @ivelinagenova
Project looks good but i think it needs a final analysis. Also you can use a list to select the features in the model. Also i don’t know if your model is accurate or not i mean there isn’t an error metric that evaluates the training error, so we don’t know if the model is overfitted or underfitted.
But still it’s a good project and it looks like you get a good result
Good luck!

eBay Car Sales Data -JF,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/ebay-car-sales-data-jf/517123,"
Hi @jesseba.fernando,
Welcome to the community and congratulations on finishing this guided project.
Your project looks good. But there are a few things that caught my attention.

It would have been great if you could give a bit more of context about the project in the introduction. You have already given a couple of lines using the markdown cell, which is great.
You have used str.replace() method along with for loop to rename the columns. This is one way to do it for sure. But if you’re using
dataframe.rename({'oldname':'new_name'},axis=1, inplace=True) it would be easier and you don’t need a loop.

The whole code will look like this
autos.rename({'dateCrawled':'date_crawled', 
             'offerType':'offer_type', 
             'abtest':'ab_test',
             'vehicleType':'vehicle_type', 
             'yearOfRegistration':'reg_year',
             'powerPS':'power_ps',
             'monthOfRegistration':'reg_month',
             'fuelType':'fuel_type',
             'notRepairedDamage':'not_repaired_damage',
             'dateCreated':'date_created',
             'nrOfPictures':'no_of_pictures',
             'postalCode':'postal_code',
             'lastSeen':'last_seen'}, axis=1, inplace=True)

With Registration year, I think we can accept cars with reg_year as 2016 since data is crawled in 2016.
From the way you have written the pandas code, I can sense that you know quite a lot about Pandas library. Maybe you were on a rush to finish this project. Anyway hope this feedback helps.

Hacker News Posts,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/hacker-news-posts/517212,"
Very nice and detailed project, good job 
The only things I changed when doing this project by myself were:


switched from “string”.format() to new f-strings.
instead of “old school” string formatting:
print(""{}: {:.2f} average comments per post"".format(hour, average))
used this:
print(f""{hour}: {average:.2f} average comments per post"")
You can read more about f-string here.


if I wanted to show this project to someone, I would certainly change the way the dictionaries are sorted. I used dict’s get() function, you can google many others:


    d = {""Kate"": 31, ""Alex"": 25, ""Nate"": 35}
    sorted(d, key=d.get) # this will return a list of keys sorted by values


the way frequency tables are calculated - something similar is needed in the 1st project.

    # instead of this
    content_ratings = {} # our freq dict
    for row in apps_data[1:]:
        c_rating = row[10]
        if c_rating in content_ratings:
            content_ratings[c_rating] += 1
        else:
            content_ratings[c_rating] = 1

    # used this - same get() function, love it ;)
    content_ratings = {}
    for row in apps_data[1:]:
        c_rating = row[10]
        # get() will set the value to 0 if key is not in dict, if key is already there - it will add 1 to value
        content_ratings[c_rating] = content_ratings.get(c_rating, 0) + 1  

Maybe these tips will help you in your 1st guided project and your future adventures in DS!

Star Wars Survey Data Analysis - My first project on github,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-data-analysis-my-first-project-on-github/425912,"
Hello @pedrolima27! Thanks for sharing.
Your project is good but here are some flaws:

You have no conclusion
Some of your plots have no title and axes labels.
You can group the dislike-like plots in one plot to make it more readable.
Your plots  on rankings by gender can have just one common axis label.
You can attract attention by coloring different bars in contrast colors (like light-grey for the least important and skyblue in those more important.

Your code is good because it does its job. It’s not overcomplicated and should be efficient. The analysis is good and can be shown to a potential employer. You can create another project based on a more business model (like which market to choose while expanding).
Happy coding!



 pedrolima27:

Also, do you think that this project is “complex enough” to be worth adding to a portfolio? Or are these analysis too simple to be shown to a potential employer?

Hello @juanjosemunozp! You have a great project with a solid narrative, extensive comments on your code and good analysis.
I only have a question on the conclusions: why do you think the a music game is a good app to develop? I’m not sure that you can advise its development just by saying that these two genres are profitable. They are pretty different from the customers’ point of view.

Hi Antonio,
Congratulations on finishing your first project here!  
Your work looks nice, comprehensive and well-balanced in terms of code cells, code comments and markdown explanations.
What I would suggest you from my side is to add more internal structure to your project: subheadings, introduction and especially conclusion, laconically summarizing all your findings and insights. Also, it would be a good idea to add somewhere in the beginning a link on the data set documentation. The same thing about the paragraph outlining the wrong data to delete: it would be good to add a link on the discussion where that wrong data was discovered.
Hope my suggestions were helpful.
Happy coding with your next projects!

Hello @raghavaseem! Thanks for sharing.
I liked how you documented your project and explained each step/decision you make.
Here are some ovservations:

You can add some comments to your code, especially to functions, even if they seem self-explainable. You will thank yourself in some months if you ever get back to the project.
In the function category_of_service you can use the OR operator to avoid repeating the New or Veteran categories.
You should add title and axes label to your plots to make them clearer.

Profitable App Profiles,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/profitable-app-profiles/517834,"
Hey, Elena!
Reads like a book, nice work 
Some minor details I would add:

code cell #2. The 5 lines of code repeated twice with only difference in data set name. You might consider put the code into a function read_data() or something like this to avoid code repetition.
code cell #3. Try to avoid magic numbers in function calls like explore_data(android, 0, 3, True) . For readability, it’s better to use named arguments and explicitly indicate what is 0, what is 3, what is True.
code cell #25. Same goes here - what is 7? why 7 in android and 4 in ios? What if  someone creates additional columns in this data? All these magic numbers will shift and no longer work. You might consider creating variables/constants with clear names and put them somewhere at the start of your project. If something changes, you need to change it only in one place.

    for app in android_cleaned_filtered:    
        if app[7] == '0':
            android_final.append(app)
            
    for app in ios_filtered:
        if app[4] == '0.0':
            ios_final.append(app)


cell code #22. You can skip the part if check == True: and put it simply if check:

cell code #27. Very nice 

cell code #34. You can use method-chaining number_installs = number_installs.replace('+', '').replace(',', '') to avoid repetition or use regular expressions which will be covered later.
cell code #36, #38, #40, #42, #44, #46, #48 etc look very similar and repetitive. Is there a way to create a function for this?

Great project!

Analysing post engagement in Hacker News- project 2,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analysing-post-engagement-in-hacker-news-project-2/473823,"
Hi @juanjosemunozp,
You project looks great, both the code itself and the project structure (different size subheadings, emphasizing, bullet points). The title sounds positive, result-orientated and attracts attention. And also I liked your idea to outline briefly the summary of results at the beginning.
Some suggestions from my side for your further consideration. The code cells [2], [3] and [7] have repetitive explanations before and after the cell; it would be better to remain only one of them. The code cells [4] and [5]  are explained twice after the cell, both as an output of print() and in markdown cells; the print outputs would be enough in such cases. Also, I would change the subheading Summary in the middle of the project (after the code cell [5]) with something less obligative, like Intermediate Results.
For the rest, excellent work!

Hello @veratsien! Thanks for sharing. Your project is nice but a bit dry.
Here is some feedback:

It’s not necessary to write the whole data dictionary but a brief introduction to the data is a good idea, also write the aim of the project
Write conclusions. Probabily a person will read only the intro and conclusions (why should I read it and what I have to do)
Explain better why you dropped all the cars outside the range of 1000-60000.
Explain better your finding the the last part of the project.

Happy coding!

Hi @yswong122,
You have done a great job with your first project that you’ve shared here. From the report, it doesn’t feel that your language needs any improvements, the report looks great. Your inline code comments and explanations on the markdown cell make your report very easy to read and understand.
I like the style of your report too, which gives a summary of the conclusion at the beginning itself. Maybe in my next project I will follow this. I’ve learned a few things from your code and report and for me that is a good thing.
If there is any suggestion, that would be to add EST to the formating at the end.
15:00EST: 38.59 average comments per post
or
15:00EST: gets 38.59 average comments per post
would have been better, that is what I felt.
Also, you can look into the pytz library to understand how to convert to the results into another timezone.
Other than that, you have done a wonderful job. Keep up the good work.

Project Analyzing Business Questions using SQL (Review),1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-analyzing-business-questions-using-sql-review/467790,"
Hello @saquibmehmood1! Thanks for sharing. If it only took several hours to finish the project, congratulations, it’s an incredible result!
Here is some feeback:

You have a great narrative, well done!
For a portfolio project, you may want to write complete queries to obtain the final result (not an infinite tables:)
Don’t you want to visualize your results? We percieve information better visually.
Write conclusions: wrap up all your recommendations in one place, that’s probably the only thing people will read in the project.
In this query

SELECT
     gtit.genre_name AS genre_name,
     COUNT(gtit.track_id) AS number_tracks_sold_usa,
        
     CAST(COUNT(gtit.track_id)AS FLOAT)/(SELECT COUNT(genre_track_invoice_total.track_id)

     gtit.country AS country

Guided Project: Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data - JM,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-jm/513570,"
Hi @jemartinezm1,
Congratulations on finishing yet another guided project I also just finished this one.
I like how you have changed the column names by assigning the new set to df.columns. But if you are using dataframe.rename({'oldname':'new_name'},axis=1, inplace=True)  you don’t have to type those names that doesn’t need any changes. Saves a few keystrokes 
Anyway you have already used rename() function to change the names of price and odometer.

With this info is better to start from 100USD than from 1USD, is difficult to assess if below this values is realistic to purchase a car, we need more info about how this market works.

I completely agree with you on this. I still couldn’t figure out if they bought a cool car for $1 because it is ebay!
Now regarding the registration year, since the date crawled is in 2016, we can’t accept values with registration year that are after 2016.  Then they will be selling cars from the future! What do you think?
I quite like how you have taken up the extra instructions. I haven’t tried changing the German to English. But I think there is a mapping function using dictionary, without needing to use str.replace(). I will update it when I find it.
You have also tried to extract the model name. It is cool. But when it comes to brands that has Two part names such as Mercedes Benz, don’t we get the second part as by using str[1]? Maybe we should use an exception with if clause to select str[2] for such brands.
Altogether you have done a great analysis. You gave me many things to think over and add to many analysis. Also, your code, documentation and markdown cells are so awesome that everything is almost self-explanatory. Great work.

Hi @chiddy158,
Congratulations on finishing one more guided project. I also finished it just last night. So i have gone through your project and found a few things you can do differently.
To Rename the columns
dataframe.rename({'oldname':'new_name'},axis=1, inplace=True)
auto.rename({'dateCrawled':'date_crawled', 
         'offerType':'offer_type', 
         'abtest':'ab_test',
         'vehicleType':'vehicle_type', 
         'yearOfRegistration':'reg_year',
         'powerPS':'power_ps',
         'monthOfRegistration':'reg_month',
         'fuelType':'fuel_type',
         'notRepairedDamage':'not_repaired_damage',
         'dateCreated':'date_created',
         'nrOfPictures':'no_of_pictures',
         'postalCode':'postal_code',
         'lastSeen':'last_seen'}, axis=1, inplace=True)

This will rename the column names, so that you don’t have to use replace function. We probably don’t need to define a function for this task since it won’t be a repeated task or anything of that sort.
I can see that you have already used rename() function to change the price column. So you can apply the same above as well.
Rest of the code and analysis looks good. Maybe you could have a little bit more fun with the data

It’s nice that you wrote the lessons to learn, it’ll help everyone willing to study SQL.
Your project is nice because you organized it in logical sections and outlined a specific aim. Here is some feedback:

Your project has an introduction but has no conclusion.
Be aware that when you calculate the average population/area and exclude the world, but you did not check for the European Union and Antarctica. Do they have these values?
In the section “Identifying densely populated countries” you lack a comparison operator for the area.
You do not need to delete the rows if you can just filter them. What if you need those rows after?
You have some typos.

Hello @jainanu827! Thanks for sharing.
Some observations:

Your project needs cleaning up: the style if not uniform
Give all your plots axes labels to improve readability

Question - Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?: it’s not clear how you answered this question, there is no plot that confirms that
Provide some more explanation to your plots (especially, scatter plots), so we can actually understand the problem you’re addressing
Similarly, provide some explanation to your data cleaning process
The Number of Men and Women in each category of Majors is not very clear, could you improve it?
What do you observe on the hexagonal plots?

Guided Project - Employee Exit Surveys,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-employee-exit-surveys/512755,"
Hello @sbrowne15! Thanks for sharing.
Your work is well-written and the code in good.
Some observations:

Add sections to your project (such as Introduction, Data cleaning, Data analysis etc.)
You can extract years jsut by taking the last four characters without a need to apply for a regex.
Give your plot a title, axes label, and order the categories in a logical way, that will help readability
You have some typos (like “seperate”), it’s better to avoid them

Overall, it’s a cool project, well done!
Happy coding;)

Here is some feedback:

You should unifrom your SQL code to only one standard (like using CAPITAL letter or aligning all your clauses)
Why did you exclude all the countries where the population is higher than the world’s average and the area is less that the world’s average? It’s just for my curuiosity:D

Hi @demircanmurat1: Perhaps you could provide more descriptions of the data using markdown as described in this tutorial. To select a cell to enter markdown into, put the cursor in the cell and press Esc + M to enter ""markdown mode"". This will enable you to enter content and perhaps have more descriptions and do more analysis with the data. I have also linked a markdown cheatsheet, which I use here for your reference.

Add .copy() to the end of the code in each cells, then restart and run all cells

Gp visualization of earnings based on college and gender,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/gp-visualization-of-earnings-based-on-college-and-gender/501046,"
Hi Lucas, really nice project! I really like your storytelling/formatting of your notebook. Your use of headers, bullets, and block quotes really makes it easy to scan your project and pull out the things I want to see/read. I also really liked your style of producing analytics and then posting your analysis under ‘OBSERVATIONS’. Very nice flow.
That being said, I noticed a few things to improve upon those strengths:

it looks like you may have used three apostrophes (’’’) to create your block quotes as opposed to three backticks (```) and this creates for some strange outputs when you run the cell. Check the outputs for “cell 15” and “cell 19” in your notebook to see what I mean.
this might just be me being picky…but…I like to see a verifiable “conclusion” at the end of a long read and you do have a bit of one there but it’s under “Observations” and it feels a little light. Your introduction to the project is so strong and I can feel your passion on the subject you/we are about to tackle. I would love to see that same energy in a clearly labelled conclusion.

Please feel free to critique my project on the same subject and offer me some ways to improve as well: GP Feedback: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors

Hi @sabritrabelsi90! Thanks for sharing.
Overall, I liked your project, it has a great logical structure, analysis and well-done conclusions.
You can add the questions you want to answer in the introduction, so we will understand what is interesting early in the project.
Also consider improving your pie plots (it’s even better if you change them to another type) since it’s quite difficult to understand what you are trying to say with them.

Project for review: Answering Business Questions using SQL,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-for-review-answering-business-questions-using-sql/503848,"
Hello,
I am writing this as I’m taking a look into your project. My observations & recommendations so far are as follows:

I’d recommend including your findings at the end of the notebook under a “Conclusion” headline or similar. Including findings at the introduction is not very common practice, though there’s nothing that wrong with it. Also, since you have included them below the diagram, some viewers might miss it while trying to scroll through the diagram.
Business questions 5, 6, 7 and 8 need some further explanations.
At some points, you have referred to the store as “Chinwook” instead of “Chinook”.
Some column names could be shorter.

Honestly, these are all my point. You did a good job!  As a next step, I’d recommend polishing some queries by taking a look at  the SQL style guide.

Also the use of pytz library is great. I’m going learn from your code.

Hi @etinosabogie,
I completely agree with you that 2nd project was much quicker than the Profitable app one. And yes, strptime() took some time to get used to.
I had a look at your project. It looks good. But a couple of suggestion.
I think it will be great if you can add some inline comment to your code, so that it will be easier to read on a later time.
Second, you haven’t mentioned which timezone this analysis has been made. It is given in the instructions too. For a person living in a different timezone, our analysis wouldn’t give desired result if we don’t mention the timezones. So please have a look at that.
Other than that, it all looks good to me. Happy learning.

If you were talking about .format() method, you have made it look easy to read and I think you are doing a good job.
If you are talking about Formating the markdown cells, you can check out this link for quick reference.
One suggestion would be to add more inline comments to your code, so that it will be easier to understand the code once we go back to it after a week or so. It makes reading easier for others too. Other than that, there is nothing much to add.
If you are interested in converting time using a python library, have a look at pytz library.
You’ve done a good job here. Happy Learning.

Hi @carologira8,
Congratulations on finishing your second guided project. Your work looks great. I especially liked how you have chosen your variable names, and made your code simpler and easier to read, especially in the time calculating part. When I was doing this part, I made it complex and lengthier by including everything in one line. Now I can see how to make it very simple from your code.
I have seen that in the conclusion part, some people here have converted the time to their local time zone. Looks like there is a library called pytz that helps with time conversion. If you are interested, you can have a look at that. Other than that, everything looks great. Nice work.

Completed 2nd Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/completed-2nd-guided-project-exploring-hacker-news-posts/498527,"
Hi @saad.5690,
Your project looks good. Everything is nicely done and code looks neat. I feel that maybe you can add a bit more explanation in the markdown cells and maybe a few more inline comments to explain the code. On a later day it will be helpful to you yourself to understand the code and logic faster.
One last suggestion is that you can mention in which timezone this data was gathered and analysed. And you can convert it into your local timezone, if you wish. But more importantly the conclusion should have 3pm of which timezone is the best time to post. I hope this helps.

Guided Basic Project - greetings!,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-basic-project-greetings/496628,"
Hi @jemartinezm1,
Congratulations on finishing your first project! This looks great.
I quite liked how you used your code to find which row to delete and to verify if there are any duplicates in iOS data set.  So far, in most of the projects, I have seen people refer to kaggle discussion and find the row number and straight away delete them. Its great that you have used a logic to find the row with missing data.
I have one suggestion. It would have been great, if you had added more inline comments to explain the code, especially at the later part of the code where you have used merge() and  takeSecond() functions. It would makes it easier to understand your code, especially a beginner like me.
There is one more suggestion, in fact. In the conclusion section, if you could conclude what you have inferred from your analysis, for eg which app we should focus because of its viability, which app category will make more sense, or profit etc, your analysis would be complete.
I hope these suggestions are useful. Once again congratulations, you did a great job with your first guided project.

Guided Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction (in R),3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-mobile-app-for-lottery-addiction-in-r/495840,"
Hi Mike,
Nice work! This is comprehensive and well written.
I was able to run all of the code in the notebook with two minor modifications. First, I opened a new R Markdown file for this script in an RStudio project, and then I saved the CSV file in the folder for that project. That allowed me to use this relative file path to open the CSV (side note, that’s one of my favorite features about R Studio projects):
lotto = read.csv(""649.csv"")

Second, I commented out the match variable because it was being included for discussion purposes as an example only. Once I did this, I could run the R Markdown notebook from top-to-bottom:
# match <- map(my_numbers, function(x) {setequal(x, winning_numbers)})

Thank you for sharing!
Best,

Guided Project: Star Wars Survey with multiple bar charts,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-star-wars-survey-with-multiple-bar-charts/495689,"
Hello,
I have only checked out your bar charts since you’ve requested feedback on them but I can give a thorough feedback on the entire project later on if you want me to.
Here are my thoughts:

They seem tidy, which I like. Colors are nice and they caught my attention. Keep in mind that color palettes are always an option, as well. I’m just too lazy to choose all the colors by hand sometimes so I just use a palette. 

However, in the last bar plot and some others, the legend is covering over some of the bars.
The tick labels on the x axis can be rotated 45 degrees, this would make them easier to read.
Instead of labeling data “fan” & “no fan”, you can try “fans” & “not fans”, this somehow sounds more intuitive to me.
Plot titles can be a bit more explanatory.

If you want to improve plot aesthetics big time, you can check out markers etc. for bar plots. You can also check out Seaborn. It has nice themes and its syntax is much simpler than that of matplotlib, which is suited more basic visualizations.
Also, don’t forget that I’m digging in too deep because you asked specifically. Good job, overall, I like your plots! They are simple and good at conveying messages. Keep the good work up!

Hi @brayanopiyo18
To create a story around the data science project is quite cool. I like your approach. In fact, my project was also something similar to this.  I hope you had fun doing this project this way.
The way you have done looks good. One suggestion would be to have a quick spell check. I understand that jupyter notebook markdown cell doesn’t highlight any spelling mistake and it makes it harder for us to overlook it. But if you can have a look into that, it would be great. Otherwise everything looks good. Congratulations on finishing one more guided project.

Hey @aniefiokuduakobong,
This is awesome. You have done a great job here. The detailed markdown cells and inline comments makes it a great work. You have put in a lot of efforts and it shows in the notebook. The way you have specified each and every variable using markdown format is so nice. The whole notebook looks very neat as well.  Great work!
Maybe the only suggestion is with this line of code
template = ""{}: {:.2f} average comments per post""
You could have added EST or WAT for eg
template = ""{} EST: {:.2f} average comments per post"" to give a better representation of the results. Other than that all good in this project.

Hi @jhnafrin06,
Congratulations on finishing the second guided project.
A few things that caught my eye on the code are below. These are not a major issue. Maybe you are already aware of it as well. But I thought I’ll mention it anyway.
Here is one of the initial for loop. for row in hn[0:5]:
You must be aware that you can omit the 0 if you want to iterate from the beginning. You can very well write for row in hn[:5]:
You have written this line of code print('') after the for loop to create a newline. The printed output looks good with an extra blank line in between. You can also use print('\n') to print a new line.
Otherwise code and markdown explanations look good. But you can always add more markdown explanation and inline comments to make it easier for others to read. Hope this helps.

My only suggestion would be in regards to this code
  print(hour,': {:.2f}'.format(avg))

Great work adapting to the situation by selecting a different building type. And good thinking to expand your linear model by using  sale_price  explained by  gross_square_feet  and  land_square_feet.
Nice investigation of outliers and data quality issues. It can be difficult to determine when and if it is appropriate to remove an outlier, but I think you did a good job of explaining the rationale.

I feel like we can always use the markdown cells more to give a better picture of our projects. Similarly, by using inline comments, it will be easier even for us to go through the code on a later day. It also becomes easier for others to go through our code.  If in case you are planning to keep these projects as your portfolio, these two points will help you. Hope this helps.

Sql cia_fact_book project review,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/sql-cia-fact-book-project-review/488390,"
Hello,
I’m currently looking at your project as I’m writing this. The points I’ve noticed include:

In the introduction markdown, you have stated three columns. However, later on, you have named all of the columns in a markdown below. I suggest you name all of the columns in the introduction markdown, that way the introduction will also seem more crowded and organized.
In the markdown where you tried to include a picture, you forgot the initial square bracket so the picture is not shown. Great idea, though.
I suggest renaming the columns using the “AS”. For example:


SELECT MAX(population_growth) AS max_population FROM facts


I think the explanation markdowns for each step should be in more detail. For example, instead of this:


Let’s explore density. Density depends on the population and the country’s area. Let’s look at the average values for these two columns.

You can give more details such as:

Let’s explore population density. Population density is calculated as … It gives insight on … etc.


In the section “Finding Densely Populated Countries”, I suggest you only include population density and country names to avoid a very crowded table since the only two values we’re interested in this section are those.
I suggest renaming the section “Finding country with the Most population and Highest growth rate” into “Finding countries with the highest population and growth rate respectively”. Since you have found 2 different countries with two highest values, the title is sort of misleading.
I suggest adding a “Conclusion” section and rewriting the queries according to the sql style guide which was included in one of the DQ courses.

Overall, good job! With some little more explanations in the sections, this project can be much better!
Best,
Dilara

Feedback Request for “Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL”,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-request-for-guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/486405/3,"
Hi!
Your code does do what it’s supposed to do, but there are a few areas for improvement when it comes to writing clean SQL queries and creating an easy to read notebook. And one little unnecessary step that could be performed more efficiently.
I’ll start with the little unnecessary step first.
In this cell where you’re calculating waterLandRatio:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land, ((area_water *1.0)/(area_land*1.0)) AS waterLandRatio
FROM facts;

It looks like you’ve multiplied area_land and area_water by 1.0 in order to get a Float for a result. While this works, the best practice way to do this calculation would be:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land,
       CAST(area_water AS FLOAT) / area_land AS waterLandRatio
  FROM facts

When an INTEGER is divided by FLOAT, the result will be FLOAT. Using CAST will use less resources as it is only perfomed on one column, whereas multiplying both columns by 1.0 makes one of those multiplications redundant. Additionally, CAST makes the intention of that line of code clear.


Now for the clean code stuff.
If code in a notebook does not have a markdown cell explaining it, comments can be used to mention what you’re doing in the code cell. It also makes it easier to provide feedback with specific, easy to find examples.
For example, the last four or five cells of code have some formatting errors; if they had titles or comments describing what they were doing, it would be much easier to name/identify exactly which cell is being referred to. In SQL, comments are preceded by -- as such:

%%sql 
-- Finding countries with greater land area than water area (comment)
SELECT *
  FROM facts   -- the table to be queried (inline comment)


While most of use here in the DQ community can deduce what actions are being performed by reading the code, if you were sharing it with someone who had no clue about SQL, they would have a harder time figuring out what’s happening.

Formatting in SQL queries makes them much easier to read. While it’s not always necessary to follow the style guides letter for letter, there are some basic standards that make a query more readable. I’ll include a few of the basics, but you can find a very verbose, in-depth style guide here.
New lines help break up long pieces of code making them easier to read.
Compare this:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land, ((area_water *1.0)/(area_land*1.0)) AS waterLandRatio
FROM facts;

To this, with line breaks:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land,
       ((area_water *1.0)/(area_land*1.0)) AS waterLandRatio
  FROM facts;

The second example puts the calculation of the water to land ratio on its own line making it clear that this is a calculation rather than just a column selection.
Building on that, consistent white space and indentation can vastly improve the readability of code. The standard is to “right align” key words and “left align” column names and functions, creating a “river” down the middle and making quick visual scans of the query much easier.
Whitespace with operators:
-- spaces between operators are best practice:
SELECT *
  FROM facts;

-- and:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land, 
       ((area_water * 1.0) / (area_land * 1.0)) AS water_land_ratio
  FROM facts
 WHERE code <> xx;
-- compared to this where it's harder to read:
SELECT name, area_water, area_land, ((area_water *1.0)/(area_land*1.0)) AS waterLandRatio
FROM facts
WHERE code<>xx;

-- and:
SELECT*
FROM facts;


Aligning key words and columns names with consistent whitespace:
SELECT *
  FROM facts
 WHERE population_growth > (SELECT AVG(population_growth)
                              FROM facts)
 ORDER BY population_growth DESC
 LIMIT 20;

The benefits are especially apparent with long blocks of code and nested select statements:
SELECT r.last_name,
       (SELECT MAX(YEAR(championship_date))
          FROM champions AS c
         WHERE c.last_name = r.last_name
           AND c.confirmed = 'Y') AS last_championship_year
  FROM riders AS r
 WHERE r.last_name IN
       (SELECT c.last_name
          FROM champions AS c
         WHERE YEAR(championship_date) > '2008'
           AND c.confirmed = 'Y'
         GROUP BY salary)
   AND r.current = 'Y'
       INNER JOIN team AS t
       ON r.crew_chief_last_name = t.last_name
          AND t.chief = 'Y'
 GROUP BY r.team_category
 ORDER BY r.last_name, r.salary DESC
 LIMIT 25;


In conclusion, your SQL queries are efficient and most of them are cleanly written but adding some descriptions and maintaining consistency will improve the readability of the code and the notebook itself, and will make future feedback requests easier.
A pat on the back is well-deserved. Great work!

Hi @ochimgold, good job! I would add some markdown to describe what you are doing and why. Maybe also your observations and findings.

One thing I have noticed is you dind’t provide any narratives to communicate your finding. You can learn Markdown Language  Here. And also, Block comments and inline comments are important for non-technical reader to understand your code and also it helps to understand your code yourself when you view in after many months! You can read all the advices that I mentiond here; a style guide that DataQuest povided.

Thanks for sharing your project, Jasper.  The way you did it is just fine, I think the team has it set up to automatically create a view link so that we can see it fine.  You don’t have to worry about anyone having to run the cells if they download and view it locally – it shows up just as it was when you last ran the cells.  
I think you did a great job!  The code is commented well and you used the Markdown cells to note your observations and steps.  I really like how you went back and mirrored the intro and conclusions to summarize everything for the reader.

Hi @walterjose.plt!
Welcome to the world of python! Glad to have you here. Congratulations on Project numero uno!
I really liked the overall use of comments for better clarity and readability, adequate use of markdown (with hyperlinks!). I absolutely love how you went the extra step to do the analysis by yourself and deduce your own insights from them. I think the conclusion part is really impressive.
For some constructive feedback, I have two points I would like to mention.
One suggestion would be : Sometimes while writing code you would want to avoid printing walls of data as a reader it sometimes breaks the flow between me and the code. I usually go along taking the top 10-20 into account which usually does the trick.
And the other suggestion would be: Markdown writing can get tricky some times. A few things I have learnt over using it have been:


Hitting enter once doesn’t put a line break in markdowns. You would need to hit enter twice. Otherwise it would seem clustered.


Sometimes while explaining the code in markdowns, the using a backtick ( ` ) might be more in-line than using Italics and bold. (It automatically highlights the part that you wish to use, which is useful when you are talking about functions, variable names, objects or classes in your code). This would essentially help you bifurcate between, say, column names and other highlights from the code-related jargon that you wish to use.


On the whole, great project. Congrats and looking forward to seeing more projects from you!
Happy learning!

hello @ayoaderonmu12,
well done, thank you  for sharing your guided project. I’m a beginner as well but hope I could contribute in a positive way to the community.
I found your project and mark down comments to be well organised. I actually learnt a couple of things, your approach to calculating the population density is different from the guided solution so I did a quick google search to find that your method is actually being used on several other websites such as Wikipedia which is interesting to note.
It is also great that you went ahead to explore the added tasks at the end of the mission and made your own analyses from them.
Once again, great effort!  
Thanks.

Wow! interesting conversations there in the project.
Just one suggestion (I understand there may not be an explicit instruction for it), try to print the first top items when showing the result of an analysis.

Hi Yihan,
Welcome to DQ community and congratulations on finishing your project. Nice work 
I noticed there was just one comment in the code and I found the work a bit difficult to follow (that may be due to my not being very experienced).
Also, while documenting your results, the markdown comments were very brief. One of the questions the project was answering was
“Do  Ask HN  or  Show HN  receive more comments on average?”
It was answered with
“Ask posts in our sample receive around 14 comments on average, while show posts receive around 10.”
I think it would have been better to make a conclusion based on the results gotten, which would be that Ask HN receive more comments on average.
I see nothing wrong with the code . I’ll just say to make things more understandable for readers.
Cheers,
Olamide

Great job! I would also recommend you considering a more holistic picture of why the project is being done, like to ask a more general question than just the one related specifically to the Hacker news website. And out of that think about the potential relevance of the results of your project for the respective auditory. For example, you want to help people, who want to promote their tech ideas or get valuable feedback, and that is why you are using the Hacker News dataset - that website is one of the best places for that. This way the aims of the project might be more pronounced and conclusions more comprehensive.

Thanks for sharing this project with DQ community!
The project has a great introduction and clean start. I would just like to suggest about the plots.


try to maintain consistency within a project. The bar plot with only edges visible seems very different as compared bar plots at the end section


you scaled the x-axis, but the tags names on y-axis are also not visible. May be avoiding all the labels and keeping every 5th/ 10th label or keeping only the top 20 tags and grouping rest of the tags in one group would give a readable plot.


try to use ylim when the bars are too small for the y-axis, and limiting the y-axis will give more readable bar plots. for example, which chart gives a quick and easy understanding of the data?

hey @Raj
Thank you for sharing your guided project and Welcome to DataQuest! 
A couple of things definitely caught my focus on your project. Without diving deep into the entire project, let’s discuss them:


Employee Type -  I hadn’t thought of employee type as a criterion for analysis while completing my own project so this was new and additional for me. Thank you! 


IntervalIndex and Interval (cells 395 and 396) - could you briefly describe these methods/objects and their relevance in the project like what their purpose is and why you have utilized them. A markup explaining the general idea/ usage maybe. They seem quite interesting to learn! 


Although I tried them with dummy values for service years, they seem to not have considered the lower limit while classifying the service tenure. For example for values: [1, 15, 16, 3, 7, 9, 10] this was the result obtained:

and for values: [1, 15, 16, 4, 2, 9, 10] this was the result obtained:

Please consider few additions for your project:

descriptive markups - brief/ summarized explanation for the purpose or function of preceding or proceeding code.
formatting the title of a graph so that it itself gives what the plot is about.

Let us know, as to how DataQuest can help you further.

Very nice! I really liked how you took the instructions only as a starting point, and then went your own way exploring the data, finding interesting stuff.

Hello, first of all, great job! There are a few points I’d like you to add, which are:

You should state that chinook is a fictional store.
You can include the database schema for better readability.
“The genres of the potential new artists are Hip Hop, Punk, Pop, and Blues” you can include this sentence in the markdown cell before the query.
I think Albums vs Individual Tracks headline deserves a markdown to explain why we’re doing this comparison and what we’re comparing before the query.
Under the headline “What tracks, albums, and artists are the most popular?”, there is an error that says: (sqlite3.OperationalError) table track_info already exists) It’s in the second cell after the headline.
“How this project helped me grow my skills” part is a good idea.

I love how this looks! Absolutely brilliant! spot on comments, great formatting of the markdowns and SUCH AWESOME visualisations! (I am yet to learn them! So excited about them now! )
This one looks way better for sure with all the extra skills you now have up your sleeve! 
If i may make one more suggestion: If you would provide some more information on the background of the project, things like: What is the dataset, where did you get it from, what the aim of your analysis itself is and then what you found out. I think it will do wonders for someone who will be reading it. Because as a reader who has no idea of the dataset itself, it made it difficult for me to follow. (In product development terms, think about the end-user  )
Fantastic job, however! Also, the last point hit hard! Sexism is indeed a bane!

hi @v.kotecha
Thank you for sharing this project.
Without going deep dive, I wish to say this about the project submission:


you have covered the overall theme of the project, as how it should be, so cool work there.  It does need a conclusion part though even if we have comments/ results in between, a closing summary adds value to the project.


I liked your idea about deviating a bit from the guided instructions and highlighting the outliers part from the instructed plots.  


Coming to your queries, these are not the true answers. These are just some quick suggestion to help you explore.


for the additional analysis, you have similar to grouping by major category. I am not sure if you have come across the dataframe.groupby function  - if not then it’s okay. If yes, perhaps try out grouping based on major and then calculating averages. Also, I may be totally wrong here. So I guess even I am gonna try this.


for the bar plots before 1. I would suggest you to perhaps add a horizontal line,  which shows the average UR of entire major category and then shows the bars for majors which are above/ below this line. so the plot won’t look like the X major has 12% UR. (I kind of had to double check that part or it may be just me!)


hope this feedback is helpful to you.

hey @Raj
first off any reason for this system generated username or that’s a style?
coming to the project, I recently found out not all HTML tags work in Github. I guess that’s why last time also the title didn’t render properly in your project.  I faced so many issues for the “market advertise” project of my own.
So you may wanna update the tags in your project for GitHub. and you can use the NBViewer method automated for us learners by @sahil. just upload your book and 2 mins later we have the NBViewer link generated here in the post.
the reason I am saying this is that your project ends here in GitHub, cant see the next steps:

I am yet not here at this mission so can’t comment on the technical front, but overall your project is a smooth read.
the best part was the word cloud. you need to mention the details either here or in your project, a commented code of how you got it. If its part of mission then leave it.
Is it possible for you to update the project right now so I may read the conclusion/ end of project?
Thanks.

My Guided Project: Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-guided-project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/476052,"
Hi!
Congratulations on the project, I know every single one of them takes a lot of grit and googling to master.
Some of the things I notice that are different in my codes:

I use inline comments above the code line, that way people read the comment first and the code second.
I don’t use titles above code blocks. But it looks cool what you’re doing.

One thing which is very recognizable is the renaming columns with a dictionary. Right now I believe that’s a lot of typing. I mean it is personal preference. But as you print df.columns you can

copy that from the output
paste and change names
reassign back to df.columns.

Another thing you might want to correct is your end conclusion. Having high mileage is a bad thing for a car, which makes the value go down 
One thing I noticed is the more technical the subject gets, the more important it becomes to know what every column means.
Finally, i would like to add that, you’ll get it. After hours and hours of googling I still don’t know the difference between .str.replace() and .replace() most of the time if one fails I try the other. Bottom line, try to find out what works best for yourself you’ll get there! Another thing which might come in handy is a cheat sheet. You can google most cheat sheets for every library 
Cheers, and keep on coding every day!

Your work is commendable.The way you have added observations/markdown in a clear manner is praise worthy.
May be going forward you might want to install nbextensions in your personal Jupyter noteooks.
It will help you in many things , including :
1) Using proper Heading and subheadings.
2) I have noticed few spelling mistakes (which is not a major issue) 

Installing extensions, will make your work look more professional.

Feedback about CIA Factbook Data Using SQL,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-about-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/463045,"
Hi!

I like that you added a markdown explaining what you were about to do, then explained your findings afterwards.
Also, you added a conclusion at the end, giving a summary of the whole analysis (although “conclusion” is spelt wrongly there). Looks good.
However, your indentation isn’t consistent. While this doesn’t affect the code, I think it looks better to mostly have the same indentation before your SELECT, FROM and ORDER BY clauses. Although that could just be your style

You mentioned that you expect the population growth rates for Japan and Russia to be negative. Please why is that?

Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors Project for Review,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors-project-for-review/469214,"
Hi @Arti! Thanks for sharing:)
What I liked:

You have a title and clear objectives of your project
You have quite good comments on your plots, answering the questings you defined earlier!
You have subheadings
Some of your plots have titles

What can be improved:

What you show the descriptive information of the dataset you may comment on it! Have you noticed something strange?
Give all your plots a title! They are sad without one.
You may wrap up all the results in conclusion! A reader could easily jump to it to know what you’ve found without reading through the whole project.
That one is probably my misunderstanding: you compare the engineering major with the mean salary and conclude that the most popular majors have higher salary… Why’s so? It could be just engineering!

Hope I can help, happy coding:)

Your plot where you compare men and women isn’t very informative. Maybe you can make it larger and play with other colors?
You may want to comment on each of your plots directly under it, not after all of them. It will help a reader to understand your thoughts without going back and forth between the plots and the analysis.

Please review my guided project on the CIA World Factbook,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/please-review-my-guided-project-on-the-cia-world-factbook/455177,"
Hello, I’m also new to data analysis but I’ve checked your project out via github and here are some things I’ve noticed:

Project could’ve been named and explained better. For example: “Exploratory Analysis of CIA World Factbook Data”. I think you could’ve told more about for what purposes you are analysing the data and what you are looking for here in general.
I personally prefer using rivers while writing SQL code. Your code here is pretty readable, too, but I find them pretty. As a next step of polishing your project, you can check the SQL Style Guide.
I think you could’ve renamed the column names of the output of the 3rd cell. Not a big deal, though.
“… click [here] to discover more interesting facts about the coldest continent in the world!” caught me off guard, how very nice of you! I’ll check that link out later.
After the 4th cell, it reads “China, is located in East Asia, and is the largest of all Asian countries…”. However, I think you should have specified “largest” as in “largest population” or “largest wall” etc… Because I read this and the sentence that crossed my mind was that “Russia is an Asian country bigger than Pluto!”. Also, you should omit those commas.

population_density = populationarea ∗ 100 is the formula you have given and it lacks a “/”.
I don’t think selecting country codes were necessary since we already have distinct country names.
I think you should’ve rounded “population_density” in the 6th cell, too.
“These countries have the highest ratios of water to land are British Indian Ocean Territory, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.” could be restated as “Countries that have the highest water to land ratios are British Indian Ocean Territory, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.”

Good job overall!

The coding part is smooth. And I didn’t find any problem in the sorted function. Kindly provide what error are you getting regarding that.
Try to add more info in form of comments for better understanding to the third party viewer. Also work a bit on the Markdown side i.e. stylizing the text. This would make your notebook more readable and comprehensive.

hey @erzinrost
Great work on this project. 
I do wish to highlight one thing - the importance of understanding your audience.
Your conclusion part is very detailed which even I am learning to achieve  And maybe, I am not from a Native English speaking background I am biased here.
Some of the words are what we call corporate (or in this case perhaps analytics) jargon, which reflects the strong vocabulary of the presenter, but may not be relatable to a common level receiver. Since the idea for these guided projects is to be able to connect with both the people who can analyze the data and people who can utilize the results it becomes imperative that we focus more on the results and its ease of understanding.
Having said that, I do admire your command of the language. . Gave me something new and at a higher level to read.

Congratulations on finishing one more project. The next hire is getting closer!
Just a few quick notes to constructive feedback:


You don’t need to save the return of the methods in a variable if you are not going to use them… just print the return, so you won’t use unnecessary computer memory;


You made a great tale introducing your project, which is great to get audience interest, but because of that I was expecting more context about why you’ve chosen those graphics, why that order, what which graphics are meant to demonstrate, etc;


I thought it was nice that you’ve isolated that majors with the highest unemployment based on 75° percentile, then you checked if they were the same majors with higher ‘Total’, it seems you’ve missed a great opportunity to use scatter plot to verify this correlation.


Overall I loved your effort into bringing more plots, more analysis, and even new kinds of plots, but I was expecting more context about them.
Nice work! Keep going!

Hi @mobosomto,
Great work. I like it!
These charts are great for personal use, but if you want to show them off to others I would recommend some modifications.

Make sure that each chart has a title.
Change x- and y-axis labels to something other than the variable name (i.e., don’t have underscores in title or label names full_time, include spaces Sharewomen)
On your bar charts only use one color.
On your bar charts don’t include a legend if there is only one element in it (i.e., mean_difference, unemployment_rate)
For long titles that spill over the charts borders use a \n where you want to split the title onto different lines.
Make sure each chart has a title.
remove borders (despine) your plots.
remove borders form legends
remove grid lines (at least the vertical grid lines).

Hope this is helpful,

I for one, really do not have a grip over the seaborn plotting library yet, but looking at how well you’ve made use of it in this project is a jolt for me to learn more about it.
Well, I don’t know what the pro(s) would say, but as for me, as regards your conclusion on the project, I would say You communicated, clearly and logically.

hi @Daniel_H
This is no feedback. We will come to that later.
We need to first discuss why the merge and concat methods behave differently. A simple representation is here
For a detailed understanding of the two methods please refer to the official documentation here. Please don’t get overwhelmed with it. Break it into smaller sections and take one section at a time/per day basis.
Why am I pushing you to do that? below are two reasons (Apologies if you have already noticed them):


The rows are duplicated still show differences. The blue ones are completely different from each other as a group. The internal difference among each group is shown by values highlighted in red.
image1017×289 18.5 KB


The concat method outputs a dataframe which starts from the index 5 instead of 0 and has gaps between the indexes. And we are pretty sure that we haven’t shuffled the dataframe anywhere till this point in the project or Have We?  


image981×250 14.5 KB
So the resulting dataframe lacks data to a considerable amount and that can very much influence the analysis. So we need to identify first why is this happening.
One factor that I could see in this project, is the complicated calculation of Year - bifurcation of first year and second year etc. I am confused about the exact logic behind this extraction and then the subsequent classification of the service category. This is causing the duplication in merge - Age group 41-45 is classified as both - Veteran and Experienced (highlighted in red box).
I assume you haven’t yet matched your answer with that of the solution. If you haven’t yet Great! I will encourage you to check another student’s same project and see the difference in this step. It may or may not be that much different from the actual solution but it still won’t give away the exact answer and help you understand, what can be done to tweak the code for a correct answer.
Just to elaborate on why I am so confused with Years dataframe, please take a look at the replication of code in the attached notebook.

welcome to the Dataquest community, thank you for sharing your guided project here. It has been a while since you posted this guided project for review but I would like to offer some helpful feedback. I hope your learning on the platform has progressed well 
I downloaded your project and reviewed the Basics.ipynb file. It seems you might have experienced some challenges initially connecting to the sqllite factbook.db, since connection was successfully established from In [5], the project can begin from this point, it is okay to remove these previous lines of code which display connectivity related errors: In [2], In [3] and In [4]

A minor suggestion would be to consider:

limiting select queries by using LIMIT SQL command particularly when the purpose is to preview the table data and familiarise with the table columns for instance, there were at least 614 rows in the invoice table and it took quite a bit of scroll to get to the next part of the analysis, don’t worry, I don’t mind, it was fun for me doing that .

I really liked that you also considered the birth date during your analysis of the total sales per sales support agent and your recommendation for chinook to keep buying albums to avoid revenue decrease is a unique viewpoint, your recommendations were very nice.

Hi @lakshmial87,
thanks for sharing your guided project with the community. I’m a beginner in the community but hope I could positively contribute. The project is well-structured and organised with suitable headings. I really like that you included an image of the complete database schema, very nice. Some minor updates:


Consider using Round function for the AVG_sales_PER_Customer and Avg_order_value to two decimal places. I think this will improve presentation slightly.


Using the $ currency before the amount when analysing the data for example czech Republic has the highest order value of $9.10 followed by United kingdom which is $8.76…


There is a back slash in this sentence which I think might be a typo?..Margeret Park had done a sales for $1584 (33.63 % ) of…


I really enjoyed going through your guided project, the analysis and final conclusion were well presented, keep up the great work!

Hi Swar! I hope your excitement flourishes and makes many impressive Data Science Projects in the future. About the project, the markdown cell content and explanations are very well written and informative, i also find that every section is in its place; overall slick from top to bottom. However, as i scrolled and inspected your code, it honestly took me a few minutes at some cells (secluding the last two cells) to understand what you wanted to do, and as the analysis grew more and more complex, it really interfered with my willingness to go through. I’d suggest you look into standardizing your code structure, adding a comment every now and then that explains what a line does and why it’s important in case someone downloads your notebook! Also, do not forget to upload to your git profile after you finalized everything, It is a fantastic project ! Great Job!

Hi, Adewalade.  Looks good!  I had to chuckle because some of your comments were very similar to ones I made (How we weren’t asked to check for duplicates in the Apple data, how Pandas might make some of this easier, etc.).  Great minds, right?  A few things I noticed: If you are going to post somewhere I’d tidy up a few things.  There is a ‘Wwe’ instead of ‘We’ between run cells [8] and [9] and a blank markup line between [15] and [16] that shows up as “Type Markdown and LaTeX”. I’d like to see descriptions of some or all of the columns. Some aren’t easy to understand.  Also, Some a little more elaboration and code documentation in a few places. Why create a function to analyze data (other than the assignment required it)?  How does it simplify the work?  Why are the fields user rating, cont_rating, and prime_genre of interest?  Most of it is stylistic/preferences.  Finally, I would add a summary at the end.  As someone once told me about essays and presentations:  Tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them what you have to tell them, then tell them what you told them.    Overall, looks pretty good.  Great Job!

Hello @aditya1257:
I have reviewed your project and it was cool.  However, i just have minimal comment for you.
Hiding axis labels- You have disabled the x-axis labels for all the charts, however, you forgot to add the label to bottomost chart. I think you can modify that with one line of code which will help viewers to understand what are your x-axis labels in the charts.
Thanks for understanding.

Thanks for sharing this project, Anjali!  Everything looks good, organized with headings and analysis comments in the Markdown cells.  For the final queries, it looks over all pretty good.  Regarding the water/land ratio question, it looks like from the table that only 2 of the countries in the list have more water area than land area (ratio > 1, though Puerto Rico is still pretty high).  In the population growth question the database seems to have a line where they combined the countries in the European Union so it shows up in the list like the World population (I wonder how the breakdown of that segment would look…).  I’ll bet there are a lot of other interesting questions we could answer from this dataset as well, like the countries with declines in populations.  (It wasn’t asked, but seeing this made me curious!)

Feedback on German Ebay guided project,7,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-on-german-ebay-guided-project/450891,"
Hi Ivelina,
For my project I did the following:

divide into 5 bins using the pandas cut() function, assign the result to a new column (basically, this function marks to what bin each entry belongs)
use the groupby() method to group the table by newly created column and calculate the mean price and the ammount of each bin.

The groupby() method seemed really nice solution to me, but I don´t really know if it´s not only nice for saving some code lines but also for the RAM usage.
Anyway, you can check it up in my project here: Exploring Ebay Car Sale Data. Feedback is more than welcomed

[FEEDBACK] First Guided Project ‘Analyzing CIA Factbook Data’ Using SQL,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-first-guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/454960,"
Hello, and congrats on finishing your first SQL guided project!
Overall, I thought you did a great job. Your formatting looked good and was easy to read. I noticed a few, minor areas that might be helpful for this project or future ones:


Including CAST() and ROUND() for the sections with ratios. For example, the land to water ratio you created could benefit from both, especially if you ever wanted to have clearer rankings.


Be careful with the aggregate functions. Specifically in this project when using AVG(). For the section on densely populated countries, the ‘World’ row wasn’t excluded so some countries may have not have been included based on the conditional calculation.


Consider writing out explanations or your own interpretation of the results. You might be learning SQL for other things, but it can be helpful to practice in case you ever have to explain your work or findings to others.


I hope this was helpful! Good luck with the rest of the course!

Hi @ivelinagenova… Good day!
This is an amazing & neat presentation…
Regarding your question, yes you can have some information as backup cells. I would suggest you to name the backup cells as 'Some Interesting Observations from the Data ’ or ‘Observations’ in the markdown title cell…
To read Scatter plot, just look at the portion where the dots/scatters are concentrated/dark & compare x & y values & Try to establish a relation between x & y.

I  have checked the notebook and it’s excellent.
As you move forward and start doing real world projects. I will suggest you to concentrate on below points.

Use Headings and subheadings to provide structure to overall projects.

e.g.
> Step 1 ) Data Transformation
>        step 1.1 : Missing Values Imputaion
>        step 1.2 : Log transformation for Numeric variables
>        step 1.3 : Encoding for  Categorical variables,



Print statements in case b ) looks better than case a)
  case a) print(len(dataset))
  case b) print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))



Try to accumulate all your user defined function at one place in a separate (.py ) module may be . It enhances re-usability of code.

Hello @ArchanaSoman Welcome to the DataQuest community. Kudos on completing your project
Things to Note:

To prevent in cell 2 the autos dataframe is very large, you should use autos.head(), autos.tail() or autos.sample(5) so that user won’t spend time scrolling down the dataframe.
I can see you have Headings and subheadings, try also to include some descriptions and also the conclusion on what you found while analyzing the dataset.

Guided Project: Predicting Car Prices (KNN),2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-predicting-car-prices-knn/446558,"
Hello there, thank you for sharing your project. A question I have is why you’ve chosen 50-50 split in your uni and multivariate models instead of 75/25? Have probably misunderstood but thought 50-50 split is used for k-fold cross validation while 75/25 is used for ‘training and simple validation process’ referred to within the instructions of the project. For the last bit of analysis with k-fold validation I suspect an even split is generally required so presumably you’ve kept the even split of the data so the analysis is relatively consistent throughout the project?

Cool project!   would just suggest one thing.
Try to use a different code cell when you wish to print results of a variable which has reasonable length.
like instead of print(comments_by_hour) in separate code cell just use comments_by_hour. That way the dictionary would print as:
{key1 : value1,
 key2 : value2,
 ...
 keyN : valueN}

Hi @thanasis.papacharala,
This is very good considering it’s your first project. The project has been structured in a scientific paper style. I am referring to the use of Topic, Abstract, Data Headings. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, another way to present your project is to make it attractive for the general audience. The general audience usually doesn’t have anything specific in mind when they read through a project. So you have to guide them from the start to finish as if you are telling them a story. The idea is to narrate the story in such a way that they get excited about scrolling down the project to reveal the findings that will quench the curiosity you have generated in them.
That being said, here are the pros and cons of your project:
Pros

Added sufficient context at the start of the project
Added a good conclusion/observation at the end

Cons

Lots of outputs and graphs without any interpretation/observations

Tips


Make the reader think. An example:
Screenshot 2020-06-02 at 11.00.55 AM949×309 8.66 KB


Why are there so many tools? Is it because tools are easier to create than other apps?


Add more thoughts and opinions if you lack data to answer it.
Ex: It may be possible that the beginner developers prefer to create tools as their first app. As they are probably excited to create something with their programming knowledge. After all, creating a calculator/unit converter app might be far easier than creating a multiplayer video game.
Use markdown to style your text.
Limit rows to 5 unless it is important to display more than 5.

That being said, great work!
Best,
Sahil

hey @sabritrabelsi90
Great work on this project. I am not sure what you mean by the practicality of workflow.
I do wish to say, you have nailed the project technically and also added your personal touch to display the results.
For a more professional look for the project, my suggestion would be to use a new line character along with or without your separators like “\n”. This would be a faster and neater way to code and print results. You may use “***” for the learning purpose (and to submit at DQ) and create a separate copy for professional submissions (like at linkedIn, GitHub etc.)
One thing I do wish to highlight is the lack of markdowns in this project. Since you have done a couple of steps (not delving deep into code) differently than tasked for, you could have added a brief write-up about them using markdown cells.
I am learning this myself, and no expert. So would suggest you, look for titles about plots that are self-explanatory and give an idea of what the plots are about without being wordy.
For example : “The most signed separation type by employees for leaving the institute” to
“Prominent/Leading reasons cited by Employees for Separation/Exit”

Hey @jaotjoseph4,
Thanks for sharing!
Here’s my feedback based on a quick look at you project:

In the first paragraph, it seems like you used an incorrect format for creating a link in Markdown. You need to use the square brackets first and then the parenthesis.
I can understand how you might be curious to look at both head and tail of the dataset but when you are aiming to make your project resume-ready, I recommend that you keep just one (unless there’s another reason)

Talking about more high-level things - it seems like you need to work on telling a story with your analysis:

Use more descriptive headings - An easy way to make your project more accessible for readers is by improving your headings. Instead of using generic headings like “Scatter plots”, “barplots” and “Answer some questions using the above plots”, I suggest that you use ones that are specific to your dataset/project. I would recommend you to take a look at some of the projects other people have shared to gain a better understanding of this.
Introduce an introduction and a conclusion section that summarise the work that you are doing in the project.
Create more high quality commentary in the Markdown cells

Lastly, I want to say that you have made a good start and have lots of room for improvement. Take a look at what your peers are doing and take your projects to the next level!

Wow! I’m amazed and inspired by your work @sthakur I’m wondering if you can direct to the resources that you used when creating those posts? I’m thinking of following in your footsteps regarding the portfolio and blog posts.
On the feedback side off things, a quick look at your website shows a very-well though out and visually pleasing site. However, I believe you make it more stronger by adding or replacing some of the text outputs with charts. For example, on this post: https://sthakur.work/post/how-to-identify-profitable-app-genre/ there were little to no charts to be found and I found various parts (ie. frequency outputs) that would have been best approached with charts (ie. histograms).
I think that’s my main concern but other than that, AWESOME story-telling and website overall! Keep it up!!     Also, I sent you a LinkedIn connection request; let’s connect I’d like to talk more regarding your journey, posts or anything else.

SQL Guided Project Feedback,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/sql-guided-project-feedback/440453,"
Thanks for sharing your project @keblaine
Having taken a quick review of the project I suggest the following:


It is important you document your code. You may start with a brief introduction about the purpose of the analysis and a description of the data used for the analysis. Then document the specific tasks in the project. See this community post: Some guidelines for the guided or personal projects


Your SQL coding style is okay but it may be improved. Have a look at the SQL Style guide here: Detailed Guides to make your Projects Professional!

"Collegue Majors proyect: An important decision in life, better think it twice!",6,https://community.dataquest.io/t/collegue-majors-proyect-an-important-decision-in-life-better-think-it-twice/439084,"
hey @Daniel_H
Let’s break the feedback in two parts:
Things that stand out: 


the project has it’s own flair and workflow. I guess somewhere you have deviated a bit or modified the instructions from the GP. Apologies if I am wrong (did this project long back).


Initial few plots have titles*, labeled axes


the sections and sub-sections of the project, the intro part, and the comments in between.


use of something like quantile.


Coming to what can be improved:

an important decision could possibly be about “getting married”, “taking up a job in a different country”, “listening to Justin Bieber’s Songs” first thing in the morning (or for that matter any time during the day… No offense intended to Beliebers’s just some pun!) and so on.

Point is, your title is catchy, and making it relevant would add to its professionalism.
Perhaps a subtitle below it mentioning College Majors would also do.


having a consistent format, like plots in section D, are not as complete as in Sections A to C.


having better titles/ subtitles for plots - this of course is a part of our learning journey and even I am learning to do so.


there were certain spelling errors too, in the project. Try to proofread your project once before submission. you may take some of the tips from the links mentioned here


Lastly just curious, about printing the results of dataframe(s). You could perhaps use a different cell to display the results.
Happy learning!

hey @lakshmial87
Without diving deep and getting technical, I wish to say:


the project a good start in terms of intro and the goal section is a nice addition.


what could be added to your project is a conclusion part one after each plot, and one at the end like a brief overall of the project and its closing.


for the grouped plot, you have highlighted all the majors, but since there are so many, we can’t clearly know what is what. as an extra challenge check out the annotations in plots.


(for this plot, you can perhaps do this, annotate the most preferred and least preferred major.
So all the bars will still be visible but the longest one and smallest ones will be identifiable something like this:)

Feedback Needed for Employee Exit Survey Project,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-needed-for-employee-exit-survey-project/437251,"
Wow… This is very thorough analysis! I see a huge effort behind this work 
Nice intro, questions asked, data preprocessed and munged to find out the answers.
Job very well done!
Speaking on conclusions, I think there is a topic for research. Probably, DETE employees see more opportunities for improvement, rather than showing dissatisfaction? Otherwise why would they stay there for so long? In other words, I was puzzled by level of what is called “dissatisfaction” in this research growing together with age? Or was that number of years worked at DETE? Experience level is a bit confusing here.
Also, if I may suggest, I would separate data processing part and research part. Those interested in code are distracted by graphs, and those interested by research itself loosing the line between pieces of code  Probably, part one could be like these are the questions, let crunch some data this and that way, here are the results. And for institutes it would be rather easier to understand the pure story without the code. Like, we have processed data from such-n-such amount of people, these were the questions and here are our findings.
Overall this is very-very solid work. Congrats on a job well done!

Project “Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data” Feedback,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/project-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data-feedback/435328,"
Hi David, welcome to the community!  Congrats on completing your first project!  
I didn’t see any glaring mistakes.  You made some different choices in which rows to eliminate in your analysis, but I thought they were reasonable.  I was confused about the clean-up you did on the unrepaired_damage column after cleaning the price and odometer columns.  There wasn’t an explanation for why that was done and it wasn’t used later.
One thing you can work on, either in this project or a future one, is the writing part of the analysis.  You’ve done some of this in your project and I think you did a good job on that.  Try reading it like a document and see how it “flows” from one task to another to see where you can add more.  Give it a good introduction to set the stage, explain what you’re doing and what you’re observing liberally, and wrap it up at the end.  Headings can help break up the text to make it easier to read as well. This post has some links to some more in-depth guides that I think will help you hone this skill (I highly recommend the first one).  You can also check out some other student projects – everybody has their own style with this, and you can pick up on things you may want to incorporate in future projects.
Thanks so much for sharing with us!  Good luck on the next project!

@kevweo,
I am a beginner here too but i will like to add that, your comments in the code cell and the intermediate notes in the markdown cells explained the steps in your project very well.
I would also like to add that you should try and make all your variable and function names more descriptive and meaningful.
For example, the block of code in In[79] would have been more descriptive if you have defined the function and it’s variables like this:
def is_english(string):
    non_english = 0
    for character in string:
        if ord(character) > 127:
            non_english += 1
            
    if non_english > 3:

Hi @mariecarmelinasandri,
Thanks for sharing the project. The way you have jotted down your markdown, very comprehensive indeed. The way you have included a precise description of the functions or methods being used to manipulate the data-set in each step, I think would be useful for any beginner learners reading through your project. However, I’m not sure if this is encouraged in a documentation in the professional environment. Maybe @april.g   could throw some light here.
For better readability, I would suggest that you limit to displaying only a few rows of the data-set autos, after reading the csv. Overall, your project was easy to follow. Good job!

hey @rw1219
nice work on your first project.  Now that you have got a look and feel of Jupyter notebook, start looking for the addition of title(s) and brief descriptions for sections of the project.
Also, have a small section of conclusion/ closing at the end of the project. start with small conclusions like summarizing what has been done and what’s the final result.
I won’t burden you by saying you can refer to the official documentation for libraries you have used and will use in projects or search on Stack overflow for modifying your plots.
The best idea I have for you is, have a look at the projects submitted by other students, who have added styles/ formats to their plots.
Take the easy projects first and as you complete your track, take the complex ones. Slowly you would know how and what to search and pick from google, stack overflow, or documentation itself.
And the community supports inclusivity. we even have bugs and errors here!! (not just ladies and gents )

hey @thaysom22
Your project is a great read. The sections and sub-sections provide a good workflow.  The plot sizing is really cool 
A summary or conclusion section at the end would help in making the project a complete analysis, though.
I didn’t quite get your question. Are you looking for something like this?
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y = [10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 5]
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

fig, axarr = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10,5))
axarr[0].plot(x, y)
axarr[1].scatter(x, y)

If yes, this is one of the methods, there are other ways too. such as:
df = pd.DataFrame({""x"":[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ""y"":[10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 5]})
df.plot(kind=""bar"", x=""x"", y =""y"", ax = axarr[2]) 

You may go through the matplotlib documentation, projects from other students, or stack overflow posts as well to understand further.
Hope that helps.

image1131×108 7.15 KB

Now that we have worked on the code cells and written codes that do things to data, let’s work on markdown cells and add - titles, introduction, brief description of what the code in focus is doing, what are the results of the code and any interpretations we can make based on the results !?
you may refer to this post for more information on markdown cells:




Guide: Using Markdown Getting Help


    In an effort to make our questions easy to read, we use Markdown to format and style text. 
So - what is markdown anyway? Github gives us a great definition: 

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *. 

Headers
# This is an <h1> tag

Review: German used cars guided project,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-german-used-cars-guided-project/429393,"
Hi @ninh.luongkhanh,
Good project!
Your code is very well laid out and concise - very readable. I also like the use of headings to break the sections up.
I also liked some of the language (e.g., “Let’s take a look at the min and max values of the ‘price’ column to see if there are any anomalies.”). It shows you have a curious mindset, which leads to a rigor in your analysis. This comes in handy for data cleaning.
I also appreciate your work in going beyond the Guided Project and try to tackle the more interesting questions such as characterizing relationships between variables (e.g., price and odometer readings; damage and non-damage cars, etc).
A couple of next steps that I offer your to consider:

You mentioned you encountered a ‘SettingWithCopyWarning’. You can resolve this by use .loc or using df.copy(). Check out this StackOverflow post for more details on what you keep getting the error.
I loved challenge #4 on trying to see the trends of price and mileage. One minor thing in your code:
mileage_50k_150k = autos[(autos['odometer_km'] >= 50000) & (autos['odometer_km'] <= 100000)]['price'].mean()
mileage_above_150k = autos[autos['odometer_km'] >= 100000]['price'].mean()


Be careful here because you are double counting vehicles with a odometer reading of 100,000 in both these groups. I believe you wanted < 100000 in the first line.

You might want to start experimenting with graphs such as using matplotlib and seaborn. This will really make your trends pop out to readers, as well as help you understand the data better. If you are not there yet in Dataquest, that’s fine! But you can always return to this project at a later date and build on.
Lastly, and this may be a personal stylistic thing based on my education and background, but I always like to include a limitations section of my analysis as well as future analyses that could be done. I feel this sets the proper context in which you can draw your conclusions, and give readers (or yourself!) ideas to explore later on.

Good project and keep it up!

Hi @Arti!
This seems to be very similar to the solution notebook which is fine to start off!!
It can be very nerve racking trying to do an analysis solo. But, everyone - expert or beginner Googles code every day. It’s nothing to be ashamed of! It’s impossible to know every feature of every package or the answer to every problem you encounter.
I really encourage you to continue studying on DataQuest and then come back to this project. At this project we had not yet learned more complex data cleaning strategies or even graphing data! You can learn some great plotting techniques and really take this project to the next level!

Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets/432041,"
Hey @nelsonlupanda, Congratulations on completing your first guided project. Great work.
However, here are some little observations i think is necessary.
On your code cell ln [7]: your can’t have two return statements placed the way your did. Anything after the first return statement would not execute.
# checking duplicates for both data set
def duplicate(dataset): # to take any dataset
duplicate_apps =  # for duplicates apps
unique_apps =  # for unique apps
for app in dataset:
name = app[0] # store the name of the app
if name in unique_apps:
duplicate_apps.append(name)
else:
unique_apps.append(name)
return duplicate_apps
return unique_apps
If you wan to return 2 or more values at  the same time, It is more appropriate to so as below, but this would return a tuple of lists:
# checking duplicates for both data set
def duplicate(dataset): # to take any dataset
duplicate_apps =  # for duplicates apps
unique_apps =  # for unique apps
for app in dataset:
name = app[0] # store the name of the app
if name in unique_apps:
duplicate_apps.append(name)
return duplicate_apps, unique_apps
Also, the output of your code cell [In 22]: is too verbose, you can choose to display on the first, 5, 10 , 15 values of your values rather than, all the output. This makes your work much more presentable and readable.
Not withstanding, Great job done.

Review guided project: Visualizing Earning based on college majors,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-guided-project-visualizing-earning-based-on-college-majors/429478,"
Hi @raduspaimoc!
I really enjoyed your project. Here is my comments (for your consideration of course!). Most of my comments are more stylistic.
What I really liked:

Very well laid out, and excellent use of headings and link embeds.
I loved the hexbins. Never heard of this graph before haha!
I loved the scatterplot matrices. Excellent choice to show
I love the combination of tables and graphs to tell the narrative. You also used a variety of different graphically techniques that makes your project stand out. Very well thought out.
This in combination with your Jupyter lab bolding in text (e.g., cell 29) is fantastic!
I loved the summary and conclusion at the end. After a thorough analysis, I am glad to see you summarized it.

Technical comments


Dropping the null values. In the case of this project, there was only up to 4 distinct rows with null values. Depending where you are in DQ, you will learn about imputation. Going forward, you want to investigate why these null values are there. You may be able to determine the values based on other columns. You will also understand your data more because often times you will see some nuances you didn’t know before.
On cell 29, I believe you meant to say “16.8% of the majors are predominantly female”.
I believe there is some repetition between the findings in cell 29 and cell 32.

Stylistic comments

For some of your graphs, you might want to make the axis labels and titles a bit bigger.
You might want to include some text underneath the graphs. It becomes a bit challenging after seeing so many graphs to follow what is going on (e.g., the row of histograms, then saying “according to the histogram…” - which histograms for which conclusions?. I do recognize you have your comments at the bottom of each series of plots, which is great. But you might want to consider adding a few sentence summaries after the graphs to point out the trend (not always that obvious to the non data initiated!).
I would never be afraid to do some additional research into why the trends I see are what they are and put the references into the notebook. For example, what are some reasons why some majors have more females than males?; Why does mathematics and computer science have some of the highest unemployment rates? Do these vary by gender? I am not saying conduct a thesis level of research, but don’t be shy to offer some explanation for some findings. Or why they make sense or don’t make sense. I realize this may be beyond the scope of the project, but it would add tremendous value to your analysis, and show off your research abilities.
I found some typos throughout. You might want to consider copying and pasting into a Word document to do a quick spell check. Also I would try to avoid informal language such as “gonna” 


Overall, really good job raduspaimoc. Very thorough. I look forward to your next project!

Hi Paul.  Another really solid project here.  I really like how you set it up in your introduction that the purpose is to explore how the different graphs can help us analyze the data, and throughout the project explained how each step fits in with this goal.  It really helps to bring it all together even with the wide variety of graphs.
By the way, you can get rid of the warning at cell 20 (with the groupby bar plot) by putting in 'Men', 'Women' as a list, like so:
recent_grads.groupby('Major_category')[['Men', 'Women']].sum().plot.bar()

I think this was a change in Pandas 1.0.0.  You can check out the documentation for more info on it (the subsection that says “Selecting Columns from a Grouped DataFrame”).

You have a great recipe for a project, - title, intro, plots, conclusions, yet you forgot one main ingredient! intermediate write-up small and just explaining what the analysis is about.
Maybe the next project forth would have markdowns as well.
two questions

you marked avg prices in the plot on left, why not mark the avg mileage as well on the right?
why comment out the geographical plot, why left on the user. What if I don’t have folium or other necessary libraries? 


The detailed conclusion is  cool.

Hi @thaysom22! I enjoyed reading your project. You’ve written a very clean code with lots of comments. I also saw that you used lambda functions that are the object of the next DQ missions so great on learning about them early on!
A few suggestions:

You could include the results of your project in the beginning so people may understand what you’ve found out before reading the whole project.
Hence you can finish your project with conclusions describing if you’ve achieved your aim and a more thorough analysis of your observations.
You’ve stubmled upon the SettingWithCopyWarning. Make sure that this warning doesn’t cause any problem in your code! You may read more about this warning here.

It seems like you have used a mix of different levels of headings to write some descriptions (cells in their 30s). That creates an unpleasant reading experience.
You are also printing some dictionaries and dataframes that take up a lot of space. I mean I understand how they help you see what’s happening in your code but I would suggest that you remove such print statements from the final notebook.

Welcome to DQ community @gitudaniel
this is a delayed response. but better late than never. Now that we know how to use both markdown and code cells, now let’s focus on how to utilize each cell better.
we have a styling guide for reference that you can go through, and we can take one thing at a time from and learn it step by step.
for starters you can work on:


an appropriate title and intro for your project.


adding comments in you code cells summarizing what the code is like as below:
  # create dictionary with old column names and keys and new column names as values
  cols_dict = {'dateCrawled': 'date_crawled',
  'name': 'name',
  'seller': 'seller',......



provide a more readable conclusion, if necessary with a unit of measurement. As in for the current project, we can’t make what does  6146 really signifies here. Is it like 6000$ cheaper or 6000 times cheaper or 6000 cars are non-damaged and so on?

Hi Paul, congrats on completing your project!  The last few cells weren’t run before the file was saved and uploaded, so I had to download the file and run it to see the last few at the end.  Just a heads up. 
It looks pretty good!  I would advise that you move your conclusion to the end of the project and summarize everything (including the further analysis).  We at DQ know that the further analysis was an extra challenge and not part of the guided project, but an outside observer wouldn’t know that.  It will help bring the guided and challenge part together for those readers.

hey @aldoni.latumahina
Your efforts and enjoyment both are visible in this project 
Let’s first start with what’s different in your project:

The format of presenting - 2. Identifying values in the columns.
the center alignment for the plots. I have thought about this but didn’t really google it up so now I have a source to start with 

the narrative is cool and grouping of column names is an addition!
top 3 and bottom 3 analysis also help in summarizing favoritism
additional analysis of ratings (pop_score) calculation.

Few things I wish to highlight in this project:


lack of an introduction, you have given efforts and focus on giving a context to almost each and every section then why not to the whole project at the onset? just briefly summarizing what’s the objective of the project and some info on its data-source.


you deviated from the instructions while calculating the pop_score and avg. income etc. This analysis could have been more detailed both in terms of code and markdown, thereby making it a focal point of your project. and why is everything in one single code cell 


Thank you or sharing this project with DQ community. It has given me a few things to explore and learn.
Lastly, any particular reason to comment out the last analysis and not include it as part of the project?

Hi Imer, congrats on completing your project!  I thought you did a good job of explaining to the reader what you were doing and explaining the conclusions based on the steps you performed.  The numbers and values look consistent with other students’ projects.  I would recommend a concluding paragraph that summarized your results and what data cleaning steps to make the project feel complete.
I’m not sure what the “Comparing brand vs model” is supposed to be showing though.  I couldn’t tell what criteria was used to make each model the “top” model for each brand (it looks like it’s reverse alphabetical order).  For example if we look up just the Volkswagen models, we can see that Golf has the most entries:
autos[autos['brand'] == 'volkswagen']['model'].value_counts()

golf           3707
polo           1609

hey @ElisaDellAglio
Based on a swift glance at your project, I wish to highlight a few things:

technically you have done the project, you may now focus on attempting the extra questions since this is a small project, to begin with.
you had small narrative in-between, perhaps you can think about more context to the code and it’s objective. - This is based on the conclusion part where-in you have added your ideas about outliers and there-by affecting the data.
instead of print() command, you may try put the output codes in different cells so that results are displayed vertically and are easily understood (and compared) like the Code Cell 8.

Yes, your code is readable and not confusing. Since even I have done step #5 the same way, so It is Correct!  kidding… it gives us the correct results, and the conclusions about some registration years falling outside a valid range are right, so it should be correct.
You have taken the efforts to complete the additional task so that’s a plus too. 
Your narrative is cool and your project has an elegant workflow.

HI Ogahi.  The attached notebook was exactly what we needed to see (the link just shows me my own project).  Thanks for sharing!
Everything in the code looked good up until we get the averages by hour.  The numbers didn’t look right, so I went further up into the code to see what might have gone wrong.  The problem seems to be in the cell where result_list and the comments_by_hour and counts_by_hour dictionaries are created. I copied it below and added some comments to help you troubleshoot.  The main problem seems to be the use of ask_comments_no.  This was a variable used in a previous loop, so its value is stuck at 2.
import datetime as dt 

result_list = []

for row in ask_posts:
    created_at = row[6]
    result_list.append([created_at, ask_comments_no])   #ask_comments_no is always 2 from last loop
        
counts_by_hour = {}
comments_by_hour = {}
date_format = ""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M""

for row in result_list:
    comments_date = row[0]
    comments_hour = dt.datetime.strptime(comments_date, date_format).strftime(""%H"")
    
    if comments_hour not in counts_by_hour:
        counts_by_hour[comments_hour] = 1
        comments_by_hour[comments_hour] = ask_comments_no    #ask_comments_no is always 2 from previous loop
    else:
        comments_by_hour[comments_hour] += 1   #should be counts_by_hour
        comments_by_hour[comments_hour] += ask_comments_no  #ask_comments_no is always 2 from previous loop

I hope that helps give you some direction for how to fix the code.  Let us know if you update your project so we can give it a second look!

congratulations on learning multiple things and ways to complete, during the project. It keeps you craving for more, isn’t it?! 
well, you have completed the coding part and you have clear comments in code cells. Let’s start with phase two of markdowns as well and keep learning and improving further.
I have these two questions for you though:


what exactly is this part?



and why are the comments sometimes up and sometimes below the code.


lastly, for analysis from the below code, you can append the code with value_counts() so that instead of printing a long list of values, we can precisely show how many unique values and their counts are present in dataframe.
autos[""registration_year""][autos[""registration_year""] > 2016].sort_values()
# there's 1879 data which registration year is over 2016

Hacker News Project (my first post),6,https://community.dataquest.io/t/hacker-news-project-my-first-post/414706,"
Hi @pwan0025, welcome to the community!
Congrats on completing your project!  Things get easier over time and exposure.  I’ve looked over my first projects and they’re riddled with comments like, “This is so annoying!” and “Why did the solution do it like this??”  I look at them now and I understand, but I totally get the frustration when you’re getting started.  I think one thing that helped me was looking at posts here and seeing if I could figure out an answer (even if I never posted or it was already answered).  It forced me to review and looking at problems from different angles.  I still struggle and I’m nowhere near where I want to be in the process, but I’ve definitely grown.
It looks like from whatever struggles you had, you pushed through on this project.  You’re doing great!  I like that your code is commented and you’ve got headings breaking up the blocks.  I’m not sure why, but the 2nd code block printed out what looks like all of the dataset, so it takes up a lot of space.  (It doesn’t do that when I run it locally, so I’m not sure how to change that.)  The other thing you can practice is writing an introduction (that goes into more detail about the dataset and the project goals) and explaining the steps as you go.  It helps to polish up the project, and it also helps you solidify in your mind what you’re doing.
Have a look at other student projects too – I have learned A LOT from seeing how other people work!
Thanks so much for sharing with us!

Review Guided Project : Visualizing Earning based on College Majors,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-guided-project-visualizing-earning-based-on-college-majors/414284,"
Hey Haris, congrats on completing your project!  I like that you included some additional graphs for analysis, and you have everything labeled so that we know what each graph is for.  Nicely done!  One thing I noticed was missing was your conclusions for the scatter plots, scatter matrix plots, and hex bin plots.  It would be good to share with your reader why you thought those plots were worth exploring, and what information you got from them.  It would also be nice to wrap up the project with a conclusion so that it feels like your analysis is complete.

Hey @menon.aj,
I have gone through your project. It seems  interesting. All of the queries of the project are well written. You have added a snapshot of the database. At the same time you can add the questions just below the snapshot which you will answer with the project.
You have printed all the values of album table of the dataset. I suggest you to limit the number of items, it will increase the acceptability of your project.

hey @Raj
Thanks for sharing your project!
I am not yet at this mission. I am lagging behind actually, so I can’t comment on anything to do with your code.
I would like to share my thoughts on the plots - they are big, bold, with sharp colors and axis labels. 
Where are the titles though? at least for the bar and box plots? and “residual histogram/ plot” really?  
And the conclusion part is very detailed as well, although I won’t get it now.

Guided Project: Star Wars Survey - My take,7,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-star-wars-survey-my-take/402634,"
hey @a.xitas
Yeah! your fun and learning are both visible. Way too Visible Perhaps!!
I enjoyed reading it. But it gave me something to ponder about as well - like in an age of Big Data, AI, and Quantum stuff, are we allowed to use a couple of words in our analysis - conclusion points 3 and 6 basically.  
Moving on.


Your project is a great read when it comes to exordium (I learned a new word) and findings. But you wrote almost everything as #comments in code cells.
You can actually take some content out from there since you captured most details to make markdown cells. That way the project get sectioned and have an easy to read narrative!


your plots have clear, identifiable, and crisp colors.  a bit of additional formatting would have made them ideal versions. additions such as -  legend to show what the dotted line presents - mean value/ median/ or some percentile?


what I liked best was your findings section includes your research like ratings of IMDB, then some original thoughts and ideas like marketing decisions, then some personalized comments about forgetting a character and highlighting that if some other character had been included might, survey results may or may not be different. 


the stacked plot is a nice addition as well - with values combined together.  making it less is more example. Although (PLOT AESTHETICS) why does it not include a title?  any reason?


one last thing, you have a syntax error in code cell In [36]. Peer to peer advice, before you submit the project, just run “Restart & Run All” from kernel options.
That way the entire project will re-run and any steps which might cause a syntactical error, because we have further processed the dataset in next steps, will not throw us a syntax error.


You can get a hint of my interest in this project, by looking at this looooooonnnnnngggggg feedback!
Thank you for sharing your project with DQ community and helping your fellow learners to learn something new and different. 
Looking forward to learn more!

hey @nena.nu
Thanks for sharing your project!
This project is a good read throughout - titles, sub-titles, markdowns and comments in code cells make it so. 
just a suggestion - you could use different code cells when trying to print 5 results from segregated posts (ask and show) so that they don’t club up like cell 2.
How did you arrive at the 3 points to consider in the conclusion section? Asking to learn more from your thought process. 
Also, the average no. of comments is different, is this is different datafile. Has it been updated in the mission as well?
Happy learning and coding!

Guided Project:Star War Survey,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-star-war-survey/405199,"
Hey @alijajedonis
First off - congratulations on your first project completion + submission.
Second - Thanks for mentioning and highlighting your peer’s project you took inspiration from and giving them credits 
Third - I am feeling lazy so I am copy-pasting the same review!  well pasting the link here- Guided Project: Star Wars Survey - My take just for your reference.


You have added sub-titles to the project which creates a section and identifies what you are really trying to achieve with the code. 


I missed if for @a.xitas, but really buddies - you need to title and add legends to your plots and also refine them a bit. like for pie-chart - what is B, CAD or HS? 


giving a background for “ppscore” with installation step and a brief explanation is a plus 
although I didn’t quite understand the correlation chart but that’s just me I guess. I need to work on that.


why does the project have so many empty cells and so many warnings?


lastly, what am I missing here to understand this conclusion?



Star Wars fans are mostly between 40-60, but a good amount lies over 60 too - New fans like way more ‘Empire Strikes back’ than older ones

Thanks for sharing your project.

Hi Haris, welcome to the community!  Congrats on completing your project!
I thought this was a really solid project submission.  The code is commented well and I was able to follow your reasoning throughout.  The intro and conclusion were short and to the point, and I think they could benefit from some beefing up.  You could state what kind of interesting questions you’re hoping to answer in the intro – it helps the reader know where you’re going to go and unifies the project. I’m not sure how I feel about that giant ebay logo… .  It might be better if the size of the logo is better balanced with your introduction, but that might just be me.

Analyzing Stack Exchange data,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-stack-exchange-data/404573,"
Thanks for sharing @Raj. Nice work!   Here are my quick thoughts on it:

Out of the type of posts, we will mainly focus on the Questions and Answers. The other kind of posts are inconsequential.

I would like it if you expanded on this a little more. What are the types of posts? What makes the other kind of posts inconsequential?
You can improve your functions by including a short docstring that describes what the function does. Something like:
def count_tags(tag, data):
"""""" 
Returns the number of posts tagged with the topic (tag) passed.
:param tag: string containing the name of the tag
[...]
""""""

Also, you have some pretty visualisations!

hey @nlong
I am not yet at this mission so I didn’t read your code (I have written this almost 4 times today:( I am lagging too much in my studies  ), just glanced it through.
Few things I would like to share with you at the onset:

mentioning and highlighting a peer’s project, you checked out, learned from and added ideas and work of your own. 

one of the code contains a reference to a stack overflow post so that guides us to look at the original SO post and perhaps will lead to looking for more new ideas 

link to external documentation/ information to base your findings 


This is just a guess, but is it that the conclusions based on the wordcloud, have been drawn before displaying the wordcloud?
And any personal tiff with plt.show() just asking…

Employee exit surveys GP review,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/employee-exit-surveys-gp-review/408506,"
Hi @yashkr666. The project is well done from the technical point of view (IMHO, of course). I personally liked that you used applymap() to apply a function to two columns (when working with Job Dissatisfaction and Dissatisfaction in the TAFE survey ).
You may improve your project describing better your steps and decisions you make (like explaining why you’ve decided to split employees into 4 service categories, or like what you may see on your boxplot). You may also improve the code style by following for example PEP8 guidelines.
It would be also useful if you comment your code (you’ll thank yourself if you ever have to look at your project again!).
This DataQuest article on how to improve your project style was very helpful for me. Happy coding:)

Hi Helen, congrats on finishing the project!  I felt exactly the same way when I did this one. I think it was the first time I felt like I knew what I was doing!
Now that you’ve finished the code part, it’s time for the fun!  Write an introduction that introduces the reader to the projects.  For the different sections, add some headings to break up the blocks of code.  You can also explain what you’re able to do and why, along with observations.  For the graphs, explore the documentation and find ways to tweak them, like adding headings, labels or playing with color.  Make sure to include your thoughts and interpretations for the graphs, and finish it up with a conclusion.  Have some fun with it!

Hi Nena, congrats on finishing your project.  I thought you did a good job.  You took the time to give us a short introduction and to summarize what’s happening in the tables after each query.  There’s headings too that divide up the text into sections which is really helpful.  The one thing I thought was missing was a conclusion that wraps everything up.
Since you’re considering this project for a portfolio, you may want to consider tweaking the title and intro to draw the reader’s interest.  Give this style guide article a read and see if there are any tips you take away from it.  Not everything in it will apply to this project, but it’s good to keep in mind for the future.

Statistics sampling problem,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/statistics-sampling-problem/409810,"
Hi @hridaydhar15, welcome to the community!
I’m not sure what you’re asking.  Do you mean why the code looks like this:
under_12 = wnba[wnba['Games Played'] <= 12]

instead of this:
under_12 = wnba['Games Played'] <= 12

?
If that’s the case, have a look at what each looks like in the variable inspector.  Then examine how each of the first 3 variables in the code above are used in the loop.  That should help clarify what’s going on there.
If that doesn’t help, could you clarify what you mean to get a better answer?

Hi @ramin0vali, welcome to the community!
Congrats on finishing your project.  I liked your additional work beyond the guided project.  The comments in the code were helpful, especially since there were a couple spots where things were done a little differently (the result_list slicing comes to mind).
One thing that will help the project flow better now that you’ve finished working through it is looking at how to bring all the components together as one document.  An introduction to get the reader interested in what they’re about to see and understand the purpose, and a final conclusion that summarizes everything, will help it feel more whole.  In between the steps, share your thoughts on what you’re doing and thinking about the results keeps the reader engaged too.  This article is a really good reference that I think will help as you refine and polish your projects.
Another idea is to have a look at other students projects posted here and get a feel for what you like about them.  (And if you liked them, make sure to let them know!)

Your Feedback Please: Employee Exit Survey,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/your-feedback-please-employee-exit-survey/407380,"
Hi, @tim1albers! I really liked your project, you did ask some interesting questions (with surprising answers) like below average dissatisfaction levels for involuntary exits
Just a few things I noticed:

Why did you decide not to combine all info from DETE and TAFE surveys and to work separately with both institutions?
It would be great if you provided some insights for your first plots (like “Number of exits by length of tenure at institute” )
Some comments for the last code blocks would facilitate reading:)

As for inplace vs copy I would say that it depends on the case. Like for dropping or renaming columns, I would just reassign them to the original dataset (since you won’t probably use dropped columns, and renaming is just renaming). The same applies to sorting columns in a desired order.
I would use inplace to reset index for example.
As for copy personally in my project, I used it only when the SettingwithCopy warning arose (like when I was working with only a selection of columns from a data set). I actually used it once, if I’m not mistaken.
It may be actually quite difficult to keep track of all copied data sets .

Review Guided Project - Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors,3,https://community.dataquest.io/t/review-guided-project-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors/400479,"
Hi Sam.  I liked your approach in that you were really clear that the goal of the project wasn’t just to answer the questions, but to see which graphing tools make that job easier.
I think the statement that stuck out for me was: “We can make the hypothesis that this is due to the fact that the employers tend to pay a woman less than a man.”  You revisited this when looking at the bar plots of the top/bottom 10 majors by salary and noted that the majors that were predominantly female were also among the lowest paid.  I do think it’s an interesting point that majors dominated by women also tend to end up on the lower scale for pay, but I don’t think I could jump to the conclusion that employers pay women less yet.  I think you really do need to explore within each major (as you suggested at the end) to better see if this validates the hypothesis, since not all majors lead to the highest paying jobs.  I would be interested to see if you explore this idea further!
Since your project focused on the best tool for the job, you might consider doing the additional questions and learn about other types of plots along the way.
Great job, thanks for sharing with us.

My learning from this project is this function average_xpergroup. While working on my own project had not thought of utilizing a function that should take care of both apps with different columns and columns sequence

This is really great work.   Your plots are especially big, bold and catchy. 
And you managed to shorten the project and still be able to finalize it. I like the short README.md too.
However why NO title? that was a BIG letdown. - negative count here!
on the technical side:

please explain what this is “plt.style.use(‘fivethirtyeight’)” - I know I can google but I won’t. I and google are not searching terms today!
please explain how have you achieved the bars at different levels on Y-axis. I mean why aren’t they overlapping on the axis. or is it the above style code part?

Hi Kridge, welcome to the community!  Congrats on completing your project.  Everything is laid out really well with headings and commented code, well done.  I didn’t have issues with your English. 
I had some confusion about the analysis toward the end leading up to your conclusion and recommendation for a game app.  We saw that the games category has the most number of apps, but later discovered that it had a significantly lower number of average users.  There was some code that looked at the categories with the highest average number of users, but it didn’t seem to be a factor in the final analysis.  I think that needs to be explained to the reader so they understand why you made those choices.
I would also challenge you to do some of the additional analysis on the Games category which you suggested to see what kind of game would be best to make. The Play Store data Genres column has the subcategories that you could use for this when you feel up to it.

Hi Luis!  The coding for your project looks good, nicely commented.  I appreciate the way you break up the sections with headings and subheadings, it makes the process of reading smooth.  Your hexplot at the end is the first one I’ve seen with that color scheme, it’s got a nice vibe to it.
You may want to add additional interpretations for your graphs (particularly after part 3).  I know that you made the graphs because the guided project said so, but someone not affiliated with DQ would probably be interested in knowing what purpose they serve and what you interpret from them.  I think this goes beyond the specific questions asked in the project, but would greatly enhance it.

hey @cath.gmachado
thanks for sharing your project with the DQ community!
This is a well-structured project. You have presented everything so neatly and clearly. 
without getting much technical, I would like to suggest you just two things:


the column rename part - you could create just one dictionary with all the original column names as key and new column names as values. use one single rename command and replace all the column names in one go.


once you have finalized your project and ready to submit, in the Jupyter Notebook >> kernel options >> just run the “Restart and Run All” command.
That way all the cells will re-run once again and the outputs would be in sequence.

Feedback about Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors,5,https://community.dataquest.io/t/feedback-about-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors/400832,"
If I understand the problem correctly you are trying to answer these questions.

Do students in more popular majors make more money? Using scatter plots
How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? Using histograms
Which category of majors have the most students? Using bar plots

It would make this a more fun read if you guided us better through your thought process with some text between the plots (and perhaps had fewer plots?) and explained your results better.
For example you say

Do students in more popular majors make more money?  No, because by increasing the sample_size which shows more popular majors, median does not increase.

It is unclear to me how you reach this conclusion. Your thoughts about the data and the numbers are more valuable than the plots alone.

Hi @, welcome to the community. Congrats on completing your project!
It looks like you’ve gotten the coding part down, great job!  To make your project feel more complete, consider these additions:

Beef up the intro.  Include where the data comes from so a non-DQ user knows how you got the data you’re working with
Use headings to separate the different portions you’re working with and break up the text visually and make the findings stand out more.
For some of the print statements (like printing the 1st 5 rows), it’s easier on the reader if they don’t have to use the horizontal scrollbar when possible.

One part you want to be careful with when making decisions about what rows to drop is to make sure to know information about the dataset.  When you dropped rows based on the registration year, for example, you made the decision to go up through year 2020 (since it’s 2020 right now!).  If you look back up at the value_counts for the dates of the listings though, all of the dates are in 2016. This would would mean any years beyond 2016 would be inaccurate.  There weren’t many of these, so it didn’t affect the analysis on this project much, but it’s something to keep in mind.
Now that you’ve worked through the coding steps, consider adding an introduction and conclusion so that a reader outside Dataquest knows what this project is about, what your goals are, and what conclusions you reached.  Communicating this information to readers, along with sharing your thoughts as you work through the steps, helps others to follow your reasoning and conclusions.
Thanks for sharing with us!

Hi @fatimajahara, thanks for sharing your project with us!
I liked your extensive use of functions in the project.  It gives the code a nice clean look!
I think one of the cells was accidentally made a Markdown cell, so the code there didn’t run (between cells 18 and 19).  That is actually an important one because it’s going to affect the analysis a bit.  The android Genres column is pretty granular, whereas the Category column is more closely aligned with the prime_genre column in the iOS dataset.
The project feels incomplete without a conclusion.  You stated a goal at the beginning but didn’t present the findings of what type of app the company should create based on the analysis.  I’m very curious to see what you think about that!

hey @sam_47
Quite interesting! you are back with a project and I am back with feedback! you won’t believe I had to search you out while going through this project. I felt I have seen a similar style of work and there it was your hacker news project and my comments over it.
you actually took my feedback seriously! I guess I can officially put “feedback telekinesis” in my resume now. 
the project is smooth and structured. and seeing a different title was cool. Even I have never attempted to do this. 
and yes you have shortened almost all the results. Well, even I am learning so I guess we both need to understand where to show sample results and where to show complete results.
two questions though:

story behind pandas  poster (PDA with PD?)
why the short conclusion. Common rake your brain some more!

Without getting into the technical details of how you have derived it, I liked the way your conclusion was different, and how you infused your ideas.
You have sectioned the project well and have commented on important codes in almost every cell. 
your usage for headers and sub-headers is also cool.
two questions though -  why import Operator twice? and why no title for the project. (I understand you have put a ReadMe. but we still land directly at the github page!)
oh when I first loaded on GitHub, the ReadMe was blank. I was able to add a primitive intro just recently. It’s nice to see you have added something on readme as well.
hope to see more of it.

Hey @bhavya
Great project!!, very well structured. It was a good read.
Just a few suggestions. One, you can customize the size of your plots to look bigger. The plots are key points you are trying to show, hence they should stand out. Second,



 bhavya:

I would like to know if there is a way to find any meaningful correlation between the two results.


You could try the same analysis you did for the service category and age category on other columns (will maybe have to convert it into categorical) and observe the trend. In the end you could conclude the general subset of people dissatisfied with their jobs based on various categories and their intersection.

Now that we know how to code and plot, perhaps adding some contextual information and formatting plots should be followed up next!?
My takeaways from your project are the last two plots - Unemployment rate and Share of Women in majors, bar-plots. It was interesting to have the first 10 and last 10 values appended together and show.
Although if you had used a sorted column, we could see the top 10 and bottom 10 of each field in the plot.

Thanks for sharing your project.
I can understand your discomfort with English. It is not my first language too! But sadly Bill Gates was not born in India. On the other side, we might have had keyboards in 200+ different languages! 
Anywho, we need to work on project building. I can keep aside the English context, but seriously writing “goole instead google”, that just seems like you are either disinterested or lazy to work on your content or this project was heavily rushed!
Since this was my first project too while completing the Python Fundamental course. I based the entire project on the solution provided. My own project is almost a copy of the DQ solution. And that’s okay because we are learning and it’s the first GP in sequence.
So I would request you to have a walkthrough of the solution provided. I guess you haven’t checked it yet cause your project looks original in terms of the code.  and I truly appreciate that.
And yup, this deserves due credit - you have utilized almost everything taught to us in the fundamental missions. A big kudos to that  Even I haven’t done in any of project yet 
Please do take this feedback in the spirit of peer to peer working together and learning together.

hey @parthpatel9414
thank you for sharing your project with DQ.
first and foremost, the SQL query formats, except a couple of places is on point. Uppercase for clauses and lowercase for table/ column names. 
the headers help to define the context of each query segment. so that’s okay too.
However, the project seriously lacks an intro - simple context of what’s the actual purpose of the project. (2-3 lines would be enough too)
On the technical front, how did you arrive at the sales % figures? we see the total sales, we don’t see the proportion?  
That query could have been an additional work (highlight) for the project!

one important thing, almost every result goes into the scroll bar mode, except for the last one.
you can make the results the last code in a cell, or perhaps tweak the print method.

Thank you for sharing this project. This was short and straightforward.
The conclusion part directly under the intro was new and different for me. The sections flowed with ease and your comments explained your work process as well.
I liked your simple classification of data - young and older, that way the focus is completing the task and moving on. And it’s good to see I have 8-10 years still to see myself in older category 
two things I will highlight here for future projects:

consistency of section headers - Q1 is there but Q2 is missing and such trivial things.
why no axis labels and/or titles for plots? like what does 0.5 signify? is it a percentage or some point scale etc.

Hi Erica, welcome to the community!  Congrats on completing your project!  It looks great.  One thing you may want to consider in the future is to add some context and analysis for a future reader with an introduction (what you’re using, what you hope to accomplish, etc) and how your observations shaped the direction of the project (for example, the reasons why Antarctica and World were excluded in the queries).

First things first, it’s neat and elegant to read. 
You have created a narrative and used it well. This includes:

intro to the question/ objective of the analysis
highlighted the technical aspects required/ used for the given analysis
the conclusion with mention of timezone is nice.

The only thing I would add here:

the print of count_by_hour or comments_by_hour or avg_by_hour etc dictionaries.
a vertical, sorted and formatted content will give me the analysis result at the top (as top 3 or 5) itself.

Analyzing Startup Fundraising Deals from Crunchbase,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-startup-fundraising-deals-from-crunchbase/392573,"
hi @abidzarisprivate
Welcome to the DQ community and thank you for sharing your project with us.
Without diving deep into the technical aspects of the project, I wish to say:

The project has clearly defined sections and subsections.   Each section makes up a question. The addition would be to have a markup summarizing the results either of subsections individually or collectively.
say,


- section 2. Question 
   - sub-section 2.1
         - sub-subsection 2.1.1
         - sub-subsection 2.1.2

To conclude …

I didn’t quite get section 2.1 but then that’s the technical aspect I guess. basically, why do we have 10 rows for chunk. Please do let me know what exactly I am missing here.
(and why are we re-reading the datafile again here)
Moving on, to SQL queries, how have you devised the Top 10% and 1% data based on the number of records. I get the sorting but what I don’t get is the threshold of the number of rows rather than conditions or aggregate calculations.
One important factor I would like to highlight is the SQL Query formatting that you have used. keywords & functions - in caps, column names, etc small 
However, the non-naming of the resultant column -
SUM(raised_amount_usd) AS ""Amount Raised (USD)""
and the scientific notation of the sum results does take away the presentation of query results.
This was a learning for me as well. Hope to see more projects from you.

I enjoyed going through the project, till I came across cell 40! Is it like a thumb rule you have to love cars if you are “Male”?
how does printing names of all cars help us in data cleanup or analysis  
I scrolled down to almost bottom then gave up, closed off, came back again scrolled down, waited and then saw you have conclusions based on Name column! (It really takes time to render)
Anywho, I could see you took the course content to make a narrative for the project (copy-paste I do that too  ).
What I really like about your project was you added additional comments after almost every analysis you did, which included both functional and technical aspects of the analysis being performed. 
You have also input comments for every code you have done.
Not going into technical results, you have concluded your project well so kudos for that .
May be more in terms of formatting like bold/ italics instead of everything in the highlighted will help to increase the readability of the project.

Thanks for sharing your project with DQ Community!
The sections before each query help in identifying what the query is about, specifically putting down the conditions.  You have mentioned the answer section for the water to land ratio query.
But why not have a consistent answer cell as well, just one-liners for the results such as -

“Avg Population of the data set is :  n”

Also, why not utilize the power of sub-queries for Pop and Area Avg? The hard coded values may change if we change/update the dataset.

hi @mdfarid.arshad
thank you for sharing your project with DataQuest Community!
The use of functions and plots do come out as refreshing additions to this project. 
You have added comments as well in code cells. 
A few lines under each header could add more to the readability of the project.
Coming to the analysis, a few things I don’t understand:


why have you taken Ask and Show instead of ask hn and show hn?(apologies if the instructions said so!)


what would you do in case the dataset had different character cases for the same word.
For example: Ask / ask / ASK etc.


seeing the results of plots and the count_by_hour dictionary, the maximum comments are shown by the time 15:00. This doesn’t match with the “Top 5 hours” result.

How do I backup my Guided Projects as I'm learning?


Introduction
While you’re learning with Dataquest, backing up your Guided Projects is a great way to ensure that you never lose your work and have peace of mind.
How to Download Guided Project From Our Platform
This post covers how to download your Guided Project from our platform.



How do I download the data sets you use in your missions/projects?


Downloading Jupyter Project Data
Although Jupyter exists in a different interface than that of our regular missions, you would download the project data in the same way —via the Download Project button at the top of your notebook. Note that this will download both the dataset files as well as your project notebook file, zipped up in a .tar formatted folder.



Backup Options
Local Storage


Press the Download button as shown in the animation above
When you click the Download button, the files relevant to the project are zipped up and downloaded as a tar file.


Follow this link for instructions on how to unzip a tar file:
http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm


Create a dedicated folder where you want the contents of the tar file to unzip to.


You may want to rename your extracted folder so that you can easily identify the latest and oldest versions of the project.
Suggestion: Rename the folder to v1 if it’s the only version in that folder or else vX where X is the number of versions in that folder + 1


Here is how your folder may look like if you followed the suggestion:

Git Repository
Compared to Local Storage, this is the best option as you will be able to showcase your project to other people if you use GitHub as GitHub can render the Jupyter notebook file and show it’s contents. Also, GitHub will save you a lot of storage space.
Please check out this post to learn how to backup your Guided Project to GitHub?

This is a delayed welcome and response! We have somehow missed your post.
Thank you for sharing your project with us.
First thing first, any reason why you have uploaded a pdf version of your project (just curious to know)?
Without deep diving into your project:

it looks neat and sectioned
you have added appropriate descriptions
a bit of formatting and consistency of format may be required for the markdown cells
for certain results, it may be more elegant to display the top results (top 5, top 10, top 20, etc.) instead of entire results.

Star Wars Survey PROJECT REVIEW REQUIRED,5,https://community.dataquest.io/t/star-wars-survey-project-review-required/384948,"
Hi @parthpatel9414.  I had a look at your guided project and figured out the issue with the columns.  If you have a look at the star_wars dataframe for these columns, you’ll notice that there are no True values, only False or NaN.  This is why when you get further down and start graphing with these columns, you end up with blanks, because there are no True values to add.
If you go back to where you renamed your columns, we can have a look at the dictionary where the True values were supposed to come from:
true_false = {""Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace"": True,
              ""Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"":True,
              ""Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith"":True,
              ""Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope"": True,
              ""Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back"": True,
              ""tar Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi"": True,
              np.NaN: False}

In the dictionary, the values have to match exactly (including spaces) in order for the code to work.  Scrolling back up to the beginning where you printed star_wars.head(), you’ll find the values that you can copy and paste there.  For example, having a look at Episode II, we have:
Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones

There’s actually 2 spaces between the “II” and “Attack”.
Once you have the dictionary fixed up, rerun the cells, and you should see those other columns show up in the bar graphs.

Thank you for sharing your project with DataQuest, it reflects your efforts truly. 

You have highlighted the end results of average calculations by including suitable suffixes/ prefixes in print statements.
You have used markups for the title and intermediate analysis codes.

Would just like to add:

kindly explore printing results of a list in separate cells (or customized print) so they render vertically, instead of horizontally in a single line. Let us know if you need further clarification on this.

For extra practice you can explore the <> Practice Mode tab in dashboard and chose the practice relevant to your learned topics.
Looking forward to learning with you more!

My solution for Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/my-solution-for-guided-project-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/386655,"
hey @bondadajoshnamk
Thanks for sharing your project with Dataquest Community. 
Few things are catchy in your project: 

use of markups to describe the purpose of the query including few lines under intro section.
sectioning and sub-sectioning of the project along with one-liner descriptions for same.

Things to add:

selecting only relevant columns pertaining to the query in hand instead of displaying the entire table.
consistency of sub-sectioning (section 7 basically)

Please do consider this feedback as a bi-directional learning process, i.e. these are the questions that I could think of (in case I am asked these how should I respond to them):


any specific reason why under section 7 - highest ratio of water to land, Max() has been used. The query may want us to have more than 1 country so how exactly should we handle this scenario?


the threshold for population growth has been fixed as 3%; what was your thought process to reach this value ? random or based on aggregation/ intermediate query results etc.

Hi @mhj, welcome to the community!
I loved the Star Wars project too!  I think it was the first time I completed a project where I felt confident about what I was doing.  The code is commented well and you took the time to explain the results to the reader. (The line “Seems like the Star Wars fans know what they like! Original trilogy all the way baby.” made me laugh out loud.)  The graphs looked nice with the style you used too.

hey @nnabugwukelvin.chukw
Thank you for sharing your project with DataQuest. 
Few things stand out in your project:

Descriptive markups with a combination of texts and points
Usage of Comments for almost every code cell. 


Based on a quick glance on the project, I would suggest the following updates:

along with texts and pointers also utilize the bold/ italics etc formatting so that the pointers and key conclusions are highlighted more prominently in markups.
consistency of headers and markup texts would help in understanding sections and sub-sections better
since an error has been encountered in the boxplot, the rest of the cells haven’t been able to render their results, which you might have got while working, with to base your conclusions, but we can’t see them now.

Would appreciate if you can refer to the error related posts in the community itself or official documentation or stack overflow, re-run your notebook and attach again for us to view your project better

Hi @WathonAung, congrats on finishing your project!  Thanks for sharing it with us.  It looks like you were able to successful code in SQL to get the results you were looking for.  Each part was sectioned off with a heading so that it helps a reader know what you’re aiming to do.  To expand on the project, take some time to write an introduction and summarize your results with each step for the reader.  Pretend that someone who isn’t using Dataquest is reading your project, and that will help you figure out what to say.
Keep up the good work!

Guided project for review : Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data,4,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-for-review-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/378500,"
Hey Anjali, thanks for sharing your project.  Great job as always. 
I had one part I was confused on regarding about the price of the top 10 cars versus their mileage.  I wasn’t sure what you meant by “We can say that the more expensive the car, the more mileage it has, from the above… But in certain cases, the least expensive cars do have better mileage too.”  I think one of the surprising things we saw in the data was that it looks like some cars are selling at higher prices even though they have higher mileage.  What do you think about it?
The extra analysis steps look good, it was easy to follow.  It was satisfying to see that the cars with unrepaired damage were significantly cheaper as we would expect.  I liked that you included the stats from .describe() too so we can look at the median as well.

Guided Project: Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In,2,https://community.dataquest.io/t/guided-project-finding-the-best-markets-to-advertise-in/382559,"
Hi @sreekanthac.  Congrats on completing your project!  I thought it was interesting in your conclusion and recommendation that you considered age as a factor.  “Age is considered as a parameter because youngsters with the possibility of finding jobs faster would be more willing to spend for the online courses.”  (I’m in the “Older” camp!)
This is a style thing, but when the print(fcc_data.head()) printed out the output at the beginning there was a lot of scrolling.  If you just use fcc_data.head() and run it in a separate cell (or the last line in the same cell), the output is rendered differently and makes it easier to read because of the number of columns.  Just something to think about on the presentation end of things.  
Thanks for sharing!

Hey Evan, congrats on finishing your project!  I think you did a good job overall.  I like that everything is segmented with headings and that you answered the questions based on your observations in the various graphs.  Having some of the findings in bold was really helpful.  The “columns explained” section could a little adjusting since it looks like all the text runs together (my brain just zoomed over it and didn’t read it).

Great job with your graphs.  I especially appreciated your commentary at the end where you summed up your observations of the data.
Regarding the ticks_params method, if you did the project locally, you might be using a later version of matplotlib than the DQ platform is using.  If that’s the case, try using False instead of 'off'.

Hey @ksenia.kustanovich, it’s nice to see that you came to a different conclusion. I liked how you removed the impact of outliers in part two of the section “Most Popular Apps by Genre on the App Store”. I see that you only averaged apps that accounted for less 25% of total number of reviews. I’m curious to know why you chose 25%? Great idea on including components of social networking into your shopping app idea.

Hi @jasonsminhas, welcome to the community, and thanks for sharing your project with us!  I really enjoyed reading through your project.  You put a lot of thought into your analysis, created several useful functions throughout, and came up with some interesting ideas for app suggestions.
The only question I have is if the final analysis is included for all the apps or just the free apps.  The goals you mentioned talked about focusing on the free apps, but I couldn’t see where the paid apps were filtered out before diving into the frequency tables.
Other than that, wow.  I am learning a lot from it and will study it some more.

hi @Arti
Thank you for uploading your guided project with us!
This looks cool! 

You have sectioned the project neatly and logically and each step has its own descriptive markup.
These markups summarize well, what’s the intention of the below code along with highlighting the functions/ methods that have been used. This I really liked (and gonna copy!). 


Please consider a few additions:

adding headers to print statements where fewer values need to be printed such as Total AN posts : len(ask_posts) etc. will add more readability to the final output.
Also, lists would make good candidates to be printed vertically?

It looks like you’ve followed along well with the guide and applied what you learned about SQL to do some analysis on the CIA Factbook database.  Good job!
Another thing you can practice with this project is to add more information for the reader using Markdown cells.  This can include an introduction, commentary about your observations in each step, and a conclusion.  Explaining your findings is a great skill to cultivate too!

Hi Jocelyn, congrats on completing your project and thanks for sharing with the community!
I learned something new when I looked at your project with %sql magic!  I’ll definitely be experimenting with that later!
You had a lot of good descriptions in the second half of the project.  Consider adding an introduction for your project that explains to the reader what that project is about, information about the data you’re using, and goals you hope to achieve.   Then add conclusion will wrap everything up together.  Did you do everything you wanted to do?  Was there anything interesting that would prompt further research?  Things like that draw in the reader and invite them into the process with you.
Great job!

Thanks for sharing your project!  The coding over all looks good.  I liked how in the printed output you utlized the .format() method.  It wasn’t in the original project guide, so it’s great you learned something on your own to get it to look how you wanted.
The next step you’ll want to take is to go back through the project add a good introduction to explain to the reader what you’re trying to do and why, along with a conclusion that summarizes your suggestions for the app genre the company should make.  In between the coding cells, elaborate on the results and how that guided your next steps.  This extra information and writing help guide the reader to understand why you made the recommendations at the end.
We look forward to what you’ll do next!  Happy coding!

Hi @RayOjel,
For you first question, you could run a count of majors where ShareWomen > 0.5 to show how many are predominantly female, and one for where ShareWomen < 0.5 to show how many are predominantly male. You can then take these two numbers away from the total amount of majors to show how many have an equal amount.
For your second question, you’ll want to look at plots that compare the ShareWomen colum and the Median column.
I hope this helps,

Amazing work on the first Guided Project, Anjali!
I really like how you have described the whole thing. You have even given a description of the explore_data() function.
Here’s my suggestion that might be useful the next time you are trying to describe your functions - create a doctring. Python docstrings are documentation strings that are used to describe a class, module or a function. So, here’s how your function would look like with docstring:
def explore_data(dataset, start, end, rows_and_columns=False):
""""""
Helps in exploring datasets.

:param dataset: list of lists
:param start: integer representing the starting index of a slice from the dataset
:param end: integer representing the ending index of a slice from the dataset
:param rows_and_columns: boolean with False as default
""""""
    dataset_slice = dataset[start:end]    
    for row in dataset_slice:
        print(row)
        print('\n') # adds a new (empty) line after each row

    if rows_and_columns:
        print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))
        print('Number of columns:', len(dataset[0]))

As far as the final recommendation goes, I think it’s fine as long as it is backed up with a reasoning (which it is, in your case!).
Great job, Anjali!

I liked how you organized the project with headings and subheadings.  The code is neatly presented too.  I would recommend adding some additional information in your introduction about the goals for the project.  You’ve introduced what you are going to do in each section, and I think it would enhance your project to take a markdown block to explain the results of what you did and comment about anything that stands out in those results.

Personally, I found it a little difficult to follow you analysis because you have used heading tags for the sections where you present your conclusions. I think it would help if you could make it more apparent which markdown cells are related to which code blocks.

I have seen your project. Your project seems amazing.

It is well documented.
coding style is alright. But you can use dataframe.head() instead of showing the full data-frame.
In some cases, you have used 1 column subplot. You may use 2 columns. It increases the beauty of representation.

Couple of things to consider for the future, with your permission…

There are two sections with identical graphs (“Fires by the day of the week”) without any explanation and with similar titles. So the one, reading your analytical report may only guess that they are per day of a week. And I know how it is boring  but at least one short line with your analytical finding about each particular graph will be very helpful.
Conclusion? What did we learn from this analysis? What are further recommendations or course of action?

PS. I like your the colors of the graphs too

Hey @olasunkanmiafolabi30,
After taking a quick look through your project, I think that in order to make this project resume/portfolio ready, you might need to polish it a little more to make it more accessible to the non-technical folk as well:


Present a more coherent story - in the conclusion you try to answer “when should you create an ‘ask hn’ post on HN?”. It would be better if the whole project led you to develop this answer. So, maybe you talk about this question in the introduction and add comments whenever you discover something relevant in your exploration.

Add relevant discoveries to each bullet - You conclude some of the sections by mentioning what you found interesting. Maybe do it for all the sections?

Overall, I think you’ve done a good job. Congratulations!

Without diving deep into your code, here’s my feedback on your presentation style:


If you are looking to make this project resume-ready, you may want to add an introduction and conclusion to it. It is helpful to know what you are trying to accomplish with the analysis before I dive deep into it. On the same veins, it is helpful to read a conclusion on your project that states the results of your analysis.


You have done a good job of peppering the project with your own comments!

Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql/321017,"
Hey. Overall you did a nice job. Here are some observations/suggestions/opportunities for improvement:


Add some more comments next to the results. For example, near the beginning you found that the table has 261 rows. You could go on Google and get a sense of how complete the table is. Does it seem to have every country?
There many opportunities throughout the project for this, I won’t explicitly call them out here.


Don’t forget to capitalize limit in SELECT * FROM facts limit 5;.


When you compute the average population, you didn’t get rid of the outliers found in the previous screen (neither did we in the solution).
Returning to the point above, by having placed enough emphasis in the number of rows, you’d find that the average population multiplied by the number of countries yields over 16 billion people on Earth, which would stand out as incorrect. The point being that doing some work on the comments can help you spot issues.


When finding the countries with the highest ratios of water to land, what you’re actually doing is finding countries that have a higher than average water to land ratio. This is kind of works, but it’s somewhat inaccurate. I’d instead run something like the query below — I’m limiting to first five results to make it easier to fit the screen, but and holistic approach would be best.
SELECT CAST(area_water AS FLOAT)/area_land AS water_land_ratio, *
  FROM facts
 ORDER BY water_land_ratio DESC
 LIMIT 5;

Notice that the gap between British Indian Ocean Territory and the Virgin Islands is much larger than the gap between the latter and Puerto Rico (even in relative comparison). What even is the British Indian Ocean Territory? Personally, I do not know. Should it be excluded from this analysis for some reason?


Regarding the query that tries to answer the question “Which countries will add the most people to their population next year?”, you’re not accounting for how large the population is. Countries whose birth to death rate is above average, but are small probably won’t be adding that many people.
If, however, you interpreted the question as asking about relative population growth, then this could workout. I’d still prefer something more in line with the the query I wrote above. It’s fine, though.

Congrats on finishing your project!  I liked seeing the different types of graphs you could produce.  I’ll have to try some of those out!
I think it would be good to add context to your project with a good introduction that includes where the data comes from and why you’re analyzing it.  You might also want to also spend some time explaining and interpreting what you’re seeing in the visualizations and how the choice of the different graphs helps us to understand the data better.  I like to think of the Markdown cells as places where I get to explain what I’m seeing to someone who might not understand the code or the graphs.
Thank you so much for sharing!

Hi @MaksymKarazieiev
If you write some text about what you are doing in the Notebook then it will be better for others to understand.
Suggestion: Make a habit of writing about your project like, What are you doing in this project? What are you going to do after getting that result in the notebook? (after doing some operations on the dataset).
I am not pro in Data Science but I saw some Data Scientist Notebook on other platforms. According to that, this is the feedback from my side.
Happy Coding  .

Analyzing Hacker News Posts For User Engagement,1,https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-hacker-news-posts-for-user-engagement/309454,"
Great work @burnsdillion! 

Another idea for further analysis would be to find the top ten authors who receive the most comments and look into what kind of posts do they post. That way you could possibly find the following information:

How do the top authors write their titles?
What type of posts are the top authors posting?
What is the format of the post that the top authors using? Are they the same? Are they different?

You can use this new information to increase the value of your own posts.

I would highly encourage you to not just end it with questions, instead, try to find answers to these questions as much as you can. After all, the very purpose of data science is to pull out interesting insights from the data.
Best,
Sahil

Hi Mary,
I notice that the solution doesn’t exclude the outliers when we calculate the summary statistics while he result of AVG(area) is actually different when we exclude the outliers Antarctica and World. The result of the last query remain the same though. So is it relevant to exclude the outliers?
Thank you.
